    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe IS-LM model was developed by John R. Hicks (1937) to formalise some key ideas of John Maynard Keynes’ 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. The model contains two equilibrium relationships: a goods market equilibrium between investment and saving (IS) and a money market equilibrium between money demand and money supply (LM). In the goods market, aggregate supply adjusts to the level of aggregate demand given by the expenditure decisions of households, firms, and the government. Households form their consumption demand based on a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income. Firms take investment decisions based on the rate of interest. Money demand is determined by aggregate income (transactions demand) and the interest rate on bonds (speculative demand). The money supply is assumed to be exogenous and under the control of the central bank. The two markets pin down equilibrium output and the interest rate. The goods market equilibrium may well coincide with involuntary unemployment. Adverse shocks to autonomous investment (‘animal spirits’) or autonomous money demand (‘liquidity preference’) reduce output and raise unemployment. The government can use monetary policy, fiscal spending, and income taxes to stimulate economic activity and achieve full employment.\nIn this short-run model, prices and the capital stock are fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. As all endogenous variables adjust instantaneously, the model is static. We consider a version with linear functions, adapted from Blanchard & Johnson (2013, chap.5).\n\\[\nY=C+I+G\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\n\\[\nC=c_{0}+c_{1}(Y-T), \\quad c_{1} \\in(0,1)\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\n\\[\nI=i_{0}-i_{1} r, \\quad i_{1}>0\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\n\\[\nG=G_{0}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\n\\[\nT=T_{0}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\n\\[\nM_{s}=M_{0}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\n\\[\nM_{d}=m_{0}+m_{1} Y-m_{2} r, \\quad m_{1}>0\n\\tag{4.7}\\]\n\\[\nM=M_{d}=M_{s}\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\n\\[\nN=a Y, \\quad a>0\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\n\\[\nU=1-\\frac{N}{N^{f}}\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\nwhere \\(Y, C, I, G, T, r, M_{d}, M_{s}, N, U\\), and \\(N^{f}\\) are output, consumption, investment, government spending, taxes, the interest rate on bonds, money demand, money supply, employment, the unemployment rate, and the labour force, respectively. The constant price level has been normalised to unity.\nEquation (1) is the goods market equilibrium condition. Aggregate supply \\((Y)\\) accommodates to the level of aggregate demand which is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending. Equation (2) is the consumption function consisting of autonomous consumption demand \\(\\left(c_{0}\\right)\\) and a marginal propensity to consume \\(\\left(c_{1}\\right)\\) out of disposable income \\((Y-T)\\). Investment demand in equation (3) has an autonomous component \\(\\left(i_{0}\\right)\\) capturing Keynesian animal spirits and a component that is negatively related to the rate of interest on bonds. By equations (4) and (5), government spending and taxation are exogenous. Similarly, the money supply in equation (6) is assumed to be exogenous. By equation (7), households’ money demand is positively related to income (capturing the transaction demand for money) and negatively related to the interest rate on bonds (capturing speculative demand). There is also an autonomous term \\(\\left(m_{0}\\right)\\) capturing Keynesian liquidity preference. Equation (9) is a fixed-coefficient production function through which employment is determined. In conjunction with an exogenously given labour force \\(\\left(N^{f}\\right)\\), the level of employment can be used to obtain an unemployment rate in equation (10)."

A fall in animal spirits (scenario 2) and an increase in liquidity preference (scenario 3) both have contractionary effects. While the fall in animal spirits directly reduces aggregate demand and thereby output (despite a fall in the interest rate), the rise in liquidity preference depresses output through its positive effect on the interest rate. Both scenarios raise the unemployment rate (Figure 3). Scenarios 4 to 6 assess three different macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate output. It can be seen in Figure 1 that fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy for the parameterisation in Table 1.1 Direct fiscal stimulus is more effective than tax cuts due to the constant marginal propensity to consume. The effect on output is a multiple of the one-unit stimulus thanks to the multiplier effect. However, it can also be seen that fiscal policy raises the interest rate, which crowds out some of the expansionary effect.\n\nbarplot(Y_star, ylab=\"Y\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nbarplot(r_star, ylab=\"r\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nbarplot(I_star, ylab=\"I\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigures 4-5 further show that monetary policy mostly stimulates investment, whereas fiscal policy boost consumption.\n\nbarplot(C_star, ylab=\"C\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nbarplot(N_star, ylab=\"N\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nbarplot(U_star*100, ylab=\"U (%)\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                              \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\n\nCalculate equilibrium fiscal multiplier\n\nY_star[6]-Y_star[1] # numerical approach\n\n[1] 2.222222\n\nm2/((1-c1)*m2+i1*m1) # analytical approach\n\n[1] 2.222222"
