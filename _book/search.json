    "text": "Welcome\nThis platform provides an open source code repository and online script for macroeconomic model simulation. It follows a “do-it-yourself” (DIY) approach, empowering users to numerically simulate key macroeconomic models on their own using the open-source programming language R. Whether you are a student, researcher, or an economics enthusiast, our platform offers resources to deepen your understanding of both macroeconomic modelling and coding.\nThe platform covers an array of macroeconomic models, including canonical textbook models, models from different economic paradigms, and seminal models from the history of economic thought. It bridges a gap between intermediate and advanced level macroeconomics by providing detailed yet accessible treatments of seminal macroeconomic models. Most intermediate macroeconomics textbooks focus on graphical analysis, while advanced level materials are often more mathematical and less accessible. Our platform offers a hands-on and approachable resource for users to build both a solid foundation in modelling and macroeconomic intuition.\nThe platform’s DIY-approach aims to foster reproducibility and open-source principles in macroeconomic research and education by providing learning materials that are freely available and modifiable by everyone. The platform’s content will expand over time through new entries added by the project team. A Python extension is planned."

These models are grouped into static and dynamic models. In static models, time plays no role and all variables adjust instantaneously. By contrast, dynamic models characterise the adjustment of variables over time.\nFor each model, the chapters provide three main components:\n\n\nModel descriptions that concisely explain the key ideas, assumptions, and equations of each model. This helps users grasp the underlying concepts and intuition behind the models.\n\nAnnotated code that allows users to numerically simulate the models, examine their results under different scenarios, and produce visualisations to better understand the models’ structure and output. This hands-on approach enables users to gain practical coding skills while exploring different macroeconomic theories.\n\nAnalytical discussions for users who are interested in delving deeper into the mathematical properties of the models.\n\nTo further facilitate the understanding of dynamic models, Chapter 8 of the section on dynamic models begins with a general introduction into the mathematical analysis of dynamic models (this is mostly relevant for the analytical discussions of dynamic models)."

    "section": "Introduction: economic models",
    "text": "Introduction: economic models\nWhy do we build formal economic models? Because they help us think carefully about the causal mechanisms that generate certain economic outcomes (e.g. unemployment). Models are especially useful when the variables of interest are inherently quantitative (e.g. the interest rate and unemployment) and when several of these quantitative variables interact with each other. More specifically, models provide a precise formal representation of a set of interlinked causal mechanisms that are often difficult to analyse informally.\nEvery economic model essentially consist of three things:\n\na set of \\(N\\) equations\na set of \\(N\\) endogenous variables\na set of exogenous or fixed coefficients (‘parameters’) and exogenous variables\n\nThe solution to the model, its ‘equilibrium’, will pin down values for the endogenous variables of the model for a given set of parameters and exogenous variables. Thus, the endogenous variables, e.g. unemployment, are determined within the system, while exogenous variables are determined outside of the system and often reflect policy variables, such as the central bank interest rate. The equations connect the variables of the system. They typically express:\n\neconomic (accounting) identities (e.g. that in a closed economy without government, saving is income that is not consumed: \\(S=Y-C\\))\nbudget constraints (e.g. that business investment can be financed out of retained profits and new debt, \\(I=\\Pi+\\Delta D\\))\nbehavioural functions (e.g. that households consume a constant proportion of their income, \\(C=c_1Y\\)), which often contain key parameters of the model (e.g. the marginal propensity to consume \\(c_1\\))\nequilibrium conditions (e.g. that demand must be equal to supply)\n\nEquations may be linear or nonlinear. If a model contains nonlinear relationships between the endogenous variables, it may admit more than one solution (often called multiple equilibria).\nEconomic models can be either static or dynamic. In a static model, time plays no role and all endogenous variables are determined simultaneously. In a dynamic model, time matters and the endogenous variables adjust gradually over time.\nThe endogenous variables are typically interrelated: e.g. \\(x\\) determines \\(y\\), but \\(y\\) also determines \\(x\\). These interrelationships can be:\n\nsimultaneous: \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) determine each other simultaneously (within the same period)\nrecursive: \\(x\\) affects \\(y\\) only in \\(t+1\\) (or vice versa)\n\nUnlike static models, dynamic models describe what happens out of equilibrium.1 Note that dynamic models may contain both simultaneous and recursive relationships.\nWhether the relationships between the variables is simultaneous or recursive has implications for how the model can be solved. In general, simple economic models can often be solved analytically without a computer. If the model contains simultaneous relationships, it needs to be solved as a simultaneous system by solving for the endogenous variables through repeated substitution. This means going from the so-called ‘structural form’, i.e. the full set of equations, to the so-called ‘reduced form’, where the right-hand side of the equations only contains exogenous variables and parameters. If the system is linear, techniques from linear algebra such as matrix inversion or Cramer’s rule can be used (see Chiang and Wainwright (2005), chaps. 4-5). If the system contains recursive relationships, the equilibrium solution can be found by setting \\(x_{t+i}=x_{t-i}=x_{t}\\) for all \\(x\\) and then solving the resulting simultaneous system (more on this Chapter 8).\nHowever, often a complete analytical solution is difficult to come by. Common challenges are:\n\na model has more than 3 dimensions (\\(N&gt;3\\)): then it’s very tedious to compute analytical solutions\na model has nonlinearities that preclude the computation of analytical solutions\na model is dynamic and you want to examine the dynamic adjustment of the endogenous variables (which is tedious to do analytically)\n\nIn these cases, numerical solution by means of computer simulation becomes useful. A key advantage is that it allows you to study much more complex models than the analytical approach does. A key disadvantage is that numerical solution requires the choice of a (possibly arbitrary) set of numerical values for the models’ parameters. It is thus less general than analytical solution – a limitation which should be borne in mind. We think that both analytical and numerical approaches are useful. Correspondingly, we supplement the numerical simulations with analytical model solutions where possible."

    "section": "Solving economic models numerically",
    "text": "Solving economic models numerically\nIf a (dynamic) model exclusively contains recursive relationships, it can be solved iteratively by sequentially updating the endogenous variables from (arbitrarily set) initial conditions. This is easy to do with a computer. By contrast, if interrelationships are simultaneous, solving the system for the endogenous variables as described above is less trivial for a computer (finding the solution for \\(x\\) requires the solution of \\(y\\), but the latter requires in turn the solution for \\(x\\)). One approach is to use linear algebra: cast the system in matrix form (\\(b=Ax\\)) and let the computer find \\(x^*=A^{-1}b\\) through some algorithm (e.g. the Gauss-Seidel method).\nWe will use an approach that is simpler and based on iteration:\n\nchoose a set of numerical parameter values (e.g. \\(c_1=0.8\\))\nchoose (arbitrary but non-zero) initial values for the endogenous variables (e.g. \\(C_0=1)\\)\nthen solve the system of equations many times using a for loop\n\nIn this way, the solution gets approximated successively.\nA limitation of the method of iteration is that it will only converge to the solution of the simultaneous component of a model if the equilibrium is stable (more on stability in Chapter 8). For most static models, stability is required for the model to be economically meaningful. In that sense, if the iterative approach does not yield a solution, this is a sign that the model and/or parameterisation needs to be reconsidered. In dynamic models, stability is a key question that should be addressed in any case. Therefore, this limitation of the method of iteration may not be too restrictive in practice.\nSolving economic models numerically: examples\nA static model\nConsider a two-dimensional simultaneous system represented by a simple Keynesian goods market model:\n\\[\nY= C + I_0\n\\] \\[\nC = c_0 + c_1Y\n\\] In a closed economy without government, aggregate demand is composed of consumption \\(C\\) and investment \\(I\\), with the latter assumed to be exogenous. Goods market equilibrium requires aggregate demand to be equal to aggregate income \\(Y\\). Consumption is assumed to be determined by an autonomous component \\(c_0\\) and a marginal propensity to consume out of income \\(c_1\\).\nSuppose the parameters are given by \\(c_0=3\\) and \\(c_1=0.8\\). You are interested in how a change in investment from \\(I_0=5\\) to \\(I_0=6\\) affects the solution of the system. Through the method of substitution, we can easily derive that \\(Y^*=\\frac{c_0+I_0}{1-c_1}\\). The code below shows how to find this solution via simulation.\n\n### Simulate Keynesian goods market model via iteration\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=2\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0=3\nc1=0.8\n\n#Create vector in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nY_eq=vector(length=S)\nC_eq=vector(length=S)\n\n#Create vector with parameter that will change \nI0=vector(length=S)\nI0[1]=5\nI0[2]=6\n\n# Initialise endogenous variables at arbitrary positive value \nY=C=1\n\n#Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialisation\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  for (iteration in 1:1000){\n  Y = C + I0[i]\n  C = c0 + c1*Y\n  } # close iterations loop\n  \n#Save results for different parameterisations in vector\nY_eq[i]=Y\nC_eq[i]=C\n} # close parameterisations loop\n\n# Display solutions\nY_eq\n\n[1] 40 45\n\nC_eq\n\n[1] 35 39\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0[])/(1-c1)\n\n[1] 40 45\n\n\nLet’s break this code down a little bit:\n\nset the number of scenarios \\(S\\), define parameter values, and create vectors of length \\(S\\) in which results for endogenous variables will be stored\ndefine changes in exogenous variables or parameters (i.e. construct different scenarios)\ninitialise the endogenous variables\nwrite down the equations (solved for the endogenous variables such that every endogenous variable of the system appears on the left-hand side of an equation exactly once)\n\nplace these equations inside a for loop\n\nthe loop says: repeat the segment of code insights the curly brackets 1000 times\n\n\nnest the loop that solves the system in an outer loop that loops through different parameterisations (here for \\(I_0\\))\nafter the iterations loop is finished, save the results for the current pameterisation\n\nWhat happens is the following: in the first iteration, \\(Y\\) and \\(C\\) are calculated based on the initial values and the parameter values. In the second iteration, the values are then overwritten based on the results from the first iteration. This process continues 1000 times. In this way, the correct solution is successively approximated. If you have an analytical solution, you can compare it with the numerical one to double-check your results.\nWhen does the method of iteration fail to provide a solution? In the following code, everything is the same with the only difference that the marginal propensity to consume is now larger than unity (\\(c_1=1.2\\)). Now the numerical simulation fails to find the solution. This is because with \\(c_1&gt;0\\), the so-called Keynesian equilibrium condition is violated and the system happens to be unstable. We will discuss in Chapter 8 the issue of stability and how to analyse it formally. At this point, we simply note that the method of iterations requires static models to be stable to yield equilibrium solutions.\n\n### Parameterisation for which method of iteration fails\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=2\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0=3\nc1=1.2\n\n#Create vector in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nY_eq=vector(length=S)\nC_eq=vector(length=S)\n\n#Create vector with parameter that will change \nI0=vector(length=S)\nI0[1]=5\nI0[2]=6\n\n# Initialise endogenous variables at arbitrary positive value \nY=C=1\n\n#Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialisation\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  for (iteration in 1:1000){\n  Y = C + I0[i]\n  C = c0 + c1*Y\n  } # close iterations loop\n  \n#Save results for different parameterisations in vector\nY_eq[i]=Y\nC_eq[i]=C\n} # close parameterisations loop\n\n# Display solutions\nY_eq\n\n[1]  5.818655e+80 8.832196e+159\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0[])/(1-c1)\n\n[1] -40 -45\n\n\nA dynamic model (in discrete time)\nConsider now a dynamic version of the Keynesian goods market model that was proposed by Paul Samuelson (1939). In this model, investment (\\(I\\)) becomes endogenous and reacts to the change in consumption. Aggregate demand now also contains government spending (\\(G\\)), which is assumed to be exogenous. Consumption (\\(C\\)) responds to changes in income (\\(Y\\)) with a lag:\n\\[\nY_t = C_t + I_t + G_0\n\\] \\[\nI_t = \\beta(C_t - C_{t-1})\n\\] \\[\nC_t=c_1Y_{t-1}.\n\\] This is a dynamic model, in which the endogenous variables adjust gradually over time. However, the model is not purely recursive as investment reacts to consumption in the same period (and output to consumption and investment). By shifting \\(Y_t=C_t + I_t + G_0\\) one period back, substitution into the consumption, and then investment function, the system can be reduced to two equations that are fully recursive:\n\\[\nC_t= c_1(C_{t-1} + I_{t-1} + G_0)\n\\] \\[\nI_t= \\beta[c_1(C_{t-1} + I_{t-1} + G_0) - C_{t-1}]\n\\] We can find the solution for output analytically by setting \\(x_t=x_{t-1}\\) for all variables and then applying the method of substitution. This yields \\(Y^*=\\frac{G_0}{1-c_1}\\). The code below shows how to find this solution through simulation.\n\n### Simulate Samuelson 1939\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of periods for which you want to simulate\nT=100\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=2\n\n# Set period in which shock or shift in an will occur\ns=15\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc1=0.8\nbeta=0.6\n\n# Construct matrices in which values for different periods will be stored; initialise at 1\nC=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=T)\nI=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=T)\n\n#Construct matrices for exogenous variable or parameter that will change over time to capture different scenarios\nG0=matrix(data=5, nrow=S, ncol=T)\n\n# Set parameter values for different scenarios\nG0[2,s:T]=6     # scenario: permanent increase in government spending from I0=5 to I0=6 from period s=15 onwards\n\n#Solve this system recursively based on the initialisation\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  for (t in 2:T){\n    C[i,t] = c1*(C[i,t-1] + I[i,t-1] + G0[i,t-1])\n    I[i,t] = beta*(c1*(C[i,t-1] + I[i,t-1] + G0[i,t-1]) - C[i,t-1])\n  } # close time loop\n}   # close scenarios loop\n\n# Calculate output\nY=C+G0+I\n\n# Display solution\nY[,T]\n\n[1] 25 30\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(G0[,T])/(1-c1)\n\n[1] 25 30\n\n\nThe code solves the recursive system numerically through iteration. Let’s again break down what the code does:\n\nset the number of periods for which we want to simulate the model (here \\(T=100\\)), set the number of scenarios \\(S\\) and the period \\(s\\) in which a change in the scenario should occur\nset the parameter values and create \\((s \\times T)\\) matrices in which results for endogenous variables will be stored, such that the columns represent time and the rows represent different scenarios; initialise the endogenous variables\ndefine changes in exogenous variables or parameters (i.e. construct different scenarios)\nwrite down the equations (solved for the endogenous variables such that every endogenous variable of the system appears on the left-hand side of an equation exactly once)\n\nplace these equations inside a for loop that runs from \\(t=2\\) to \\(T\\)\n\nthe loop says: repeat the segment of code insights the curly brackets, each time with the index number \\(t\\) shifted by \\(+1\\) until \\(t=T\\)\n\n\n\nnest the loop that solves the system in an outer loop that loops through different parameterisations (here for \\(G_0\\))\n\nNote that due to the exclusive presence of recursive equations, no loop is need that iterates the equations within every period. However, many dynamic models contain both simultaneous and recursive equations. In this case, a third loop inside the time loop is needed that iterates the equations within each period so as to solve the simultaneous equations. Otherwise, the approach to solving dynamic systems is not fundamentally different from the one for static systems.\nAt the end of the simulation run, we can again compare the results from the numerical simulation with the analytical solution. However, what is perhaps more interesting is to trace the dynamic adjustment of the endogenous variables towards equilibrium. The best way to examine this is by plotting the results."

    "text": "How to create a directed graph of a model\nAnother perspective on a model’s properties is provided by its directed graph. A directed graph consists of a set of nodes that represent the variables of the model. Nodes are connected by directed edges. An edge directed from a node \\(x_1\\) to node \\(x_2\\) indicates a causal impact of \\(x_1\\) on \\(x_2\\).\nThe directed graph can be derived from the model’s Jacobian matrix.2 Let \\(x\\) be the vector containing the model’s endogenous variables and \\(f(x)\\) the system of equations making up the model. The Jacobian matrix is then given by \\(J=\\frac{\\partial f()}{\\partial x}\\). As we often also want to display exogenous variables in the directed graph, it can be useful to expand the Jacobian matrix by adding rows and columns for those exogenous variables.\nNext, construct an ‘auxiliary’ Jacobian matrix \\(M\\) in which all the non-zero elements of the Jacobian are replaced by ones, whereas zero elements remain unchanged, i.e.\n\\[\nM_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if }  J_{ij} \\neq 0, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFinally, taking the transpose of this `auxiliary’ Jacobian matrix yields the adjacency matrix \\(A=M^T\\), which is a binary matrix whose elements (\\(A_{ji}\\)) indicate whether there is a directed edge from a node \\(x_j\\) to node \\(x_i\\). From the adjacency matrix, the directed graph is constructed.\nThe code below shows this for the example of the Samuelson (1939) model.\n\n## Create directed graph\n# Construct auxiliary Jacobian matrix for 4 variables: \n  # endogenous: (1) Y, (2) C, (3) I\n  # exogenous: (4) G0\n# where non-zero elements in regular Jacobian are set to 1 and zero elements are unchanged\n\n              #1 2 3 4\nM_mat=matrix(c(0,1,1,1, #1\n               1,0,0,0, #2\n               0,1,0,0, #3\n               0,0,0,0), #4 \n               4, 4, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Create adjacency matrix from transpose of auxiliary Jacobian and add column names\nA_mat=t(M_mat)\n\n# Create directed graph from adjacency matrix\nlibrary(igraph)\ndg=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A_mat, mode=\"directed\", weighted= NULL)\n\n# Define node labels\nV(dg)$name=c(\"Y\", \"C\", \"I\", expression(G[0]))\n\n# Plot directed graph matrix\nplot(dg, main=\"Figure 4: Directed graph of Samuelson model\", vertex.size=20, vertex.color=\"lightblue\", \n     vertex.label.color=\"black\", edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.width=1.1, edge.size=1.2,\n     edge.arrow.width=1.2, edge.color=\"black\", vertex.label.cex=1.2, \n     vertex.frame.color=\"NA\", margin=-0.05)\n\n\n\n\nBroadly speaking, three types of nodes are possible:\n\nnodes from which arrows only point away represent exogenous variables (\\(G_0\\) in Figure 4)\nnodes to which arrows point but from which arrows also point away represent endogenous variables that also have a causal impact on other variables (\\(Y\\), \\(C\\), and \\(I\\) in Figure 4)\nnodes to arrows only point towards represent endogenous variables that are residuals (not present in Figure 4)\n\nIt can thus be seen that the key exogenous variable in the Samuelson (1939) model is government spending \\(G_0\\), which determines aggregate income, which in turn feeds into consumption. Consumption then feeds into investment, which feeds back into income yielding the multiplier-accelerator effect."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThis model captures some key features of neoclassical macroeconomics. The model is based on the optimising behaviour of firms and households that interact in perfect markets. Households choose between labour and leisure as well as current and future consumption. They form (rational) expectations about their future income that impact their consumption decisions today. Firms are owned by households and maximise profits using a constant returns to scale technology (with diminishing marginal returns to factors of production). Markets are competitive and clear instantaneously through flexible prices. The most important market is the labour market, in which the equilibrium between firms’ demand and households’ supply of labour is established by a flexible real wage. The level of employment established on the labour market then determines aggregate supply via the production function. Aggregate demand always accommodates to aggregate supply via a flexible real interest rate that establishes an equilibrium between investment and saving (often interpreted as the market for loanable funds). The money supply is exogenous in this model and only impacts the price level but not the real economy – the so-called Classical Dichotomy (or neutrality of money). Government expenditures do influence the real economy but they crowd out private expenditures (through a mechanism called Ricardian Equivalence).\nIn this short- to medium-run version of the model, prices are flexible but the capital stock is fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. As all endogenous variables adjust instantaneously, the model is thus static. However, expectations about future income and government spending will impact current consumption of households that intertemporally maximise utility. The model is adapted from Garín, Lester, and Sims (2021)."

The \\(f\\)-superscript denotes (expected) future values. For simplicity, expected future variables will be treated as exogenous.\nBy Equation 6.1, output is determined by a Cobb-Douglass production function with constant returns to scale and diminishing marginal returns to each factor (capital and labour). Equation 6.11 is the labour demand of firms solved for the real wage. Profit maximising firms will hire workers until the real wage is equal to the marginal product of labour (\\(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial N}=(1-a)AK^aN^{-a}\\)).1 Equation 6.12 specifies households’ labour supply, which is positively related to the real wage. By Equation 5.2 , consumption is positively related to current and (expected) future income,2 and negatively related to the real interest rate. This implies that for a higher real interest rate, households increase their saving (the supply of loanable funds). Furthermore, consumption is negatively related to current and future government expenditures. This is an implication of Ricardian Equivalence: as households know that governments will have to repay its debts in the future through higher taxes, an increase in government expenditures today is perceived as an increase in taxes (regardless of whether the government finances its current expenditures through taxes or debt).3 Equation 5.3 specifies investment as a negative function of the real interest rate and a positive function of productivity. By Equation 3.6, government expenditures are exogenous. Equation 3.7 is the goods market equilibrium condition, which pins down the equilibrium real interest rate through the market for loanable funds. Equation 3.8 specifies the nominal interest rate using the well-known Fisher equation. Equation 3.9 says that the money supply is exogenous. By Equation 3.10, households’ money demand is negatively related to the nominal interest rate and positively related to consumption (capturing the transaction demand for money). Finally, Equation 5.6 is the equilibrium condition for the money market, which pins down the price level."

Monetary expansions (scenario 2) have no effects on output and employment, capturing the idea of money neutrality (Classical Dichotomy).

Looking at Figures Figure 3.2 - Figure 3.4 , it can be seen that government spending crowds out private spending (consumption and investment). The decrease in consumption is a result of Ricardian Equivalence: the household anticipates higher taxes in the future and reduces current consumption to smooth out the impact. The increase in government expenditures also raises demand for loanable funds, which pushes up the real interest rate (see Figure 3.5) and reduces investment (Figure 3.4). There is also an inflationary effect linked to the higher real interest rate, which raises the nominal rate and reduces the demand for money.\n\nbarplot(N_star, ylab=\"N\",  names.arg=c(\"1: Baseline\", \"2: Increase in M0\", \"3: Increase in G0\",\"4: Increase in A\", \n                                       \"5: Decrease in Yf\", \"6: Increase in b1\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Employment\n\n\n\n\nImprovements to the supply-side are captured by an increase in productivity (scenario 4), which raises real output, employment, and aggregate demand.

This is because households will reduce some of their current consumption (see Figure 3.3 ) and supply more labour to smooth their consumption over time. The increase in saving reduces the real interest rate (see Figure 3.5 ) and is compensated by an increase in investment (see Figure 3.4 ).\n\nbarplot(r_star, ylab=\"r\", names.arg=c(\"1: Baseline\", \"2: Increase in M0\", \"3: Increase in G0\",\"4: Increase in A\", \n                                      \"5: Decrease in Yf\", \"6: Increase in b1\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Interest rate\n\n\n\n\nFinally, an increase in the preference for leisure (scenario 6) reduces labour supply and thereby output.\n\nbarplot(P_star, ylab=\"P\",  names.arg=c(\"1: Baseline\", \"2: Increase in M0\", \"3: Increase in G0\",\"4: Increase in A\", \n                                       \"5: Decrease in Yf\", \"6: Increase in b1\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Price level"

All other variables are endogenous, and many of them form a closed loop (or cycle) within the system. The left part of the graph captures the supply side: the labour market simultaneously pins down the real wage and employment, which together with the exogenously level of productivity determine output. The part in the middle embodies the demand side: aggregate demand (consumption, investment, and government spending) together with a given level of output determine the real interest rate. The right part captures the nominal side of the model given by the money market, which determines the price level. Notably, while the real side of the model feeds into the money market via the nominal interest rate (\\(r_n\\)), there is not causal effect from the money market to the real side reflecting the Classical Dichotomy."

    "text": "Analytical discussion: derivation of behavioural functions\nThe firm’s problem: profit maximisation\nThe firm’s profit equation is given by:\n\\[\n\\Pi=Y-w N-r k\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\n\\[\n=A K^a N^{1-a}-w N-r k .\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\nThe firm’s optimisation problem is to maximise profits using employment and capital as choice variables:5\n\\[\n\\max _{N, K} \\Pi=A K^a N^{1-a}-w N-r k .\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\nThe first-order conditions are given by:\n\\[\n(1-a) A K^a N^{-a}-w=0\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\n\\[\na A K^{a-1} N^{1-a}-r=0 .\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\nFrom Equation 3.15, Equation 6.11 for labour demand can be derived. While the capital stock is pre-determined in every period, the firm can adjust the capital stock through investment. We thus use the first-order condition for capital Equation 3.16 to derive Equation 5.3 for investment demand.\nThe government’s budget constraint: Ricardian Equivalence\nThe government’s current and future budget constraints are given by:\n\\[\nG=T+B\n\\tag{3.17}\\]\n\\[\nG^f=T^f+(1+r) B\n\\tag{3.18}\\] where \\(T\\) is tax revenues and \\(B\\) is government debt.\nA crucial assumption here is that the government must repay its debts in the future (it cannot permanently roll over its debts). The underlying assumption is that the government will eventually `die’ and will do so without savings nor debts.\nCombining the two budget constraints to an intertemporal budget constraint yields:\n\\[\nG+\\frac{G^f}{1+r}=T+\\frac{T^f}{1+r}\n\\tag{3.19}\\]\nThus, while the government’s budget need not be balanced in every period, it will be balanced over time (in a present value sense).6\nThe household’s problem: intertemporal utility maximisation\nThe household derives utility from current consumption, leisure (\\(1-N\\)), future consumption \\(C^f\\), and from holding real money balances \\(\\left(\\frac{M}{P}\\right)\\). We use the following log utility function:\n\\[\nU=\\ln (C)+b_1 \\ln (1-N)+b_2 \\ln \\left(C^f\\right)+b_3 \\ln \\left(\\frac{M}{P}\\right)\n\\tag{3.20}\\]\nThe household’s current budget constraint is given by:7\n\\[\nC=Y-T-S-\\frac{M}{P}\n\\tag{3.21}\\]\nThe income that is not consumed can either be saved (\\(S\\)) at nominal interest rate (\\(r_n\\)) or held as money on which no return is earned.\nThe future budget constraint (assuming that households do not save in the future) is given by:\n\\[\nC^f = Y^f - T^f + (1+r_n)\\frac{PS}{P^f} + \\frac{M}{P^f}.\n\\tag{3.22}\\]\nUsing the Fisher equation \\((1+r)=(1+r_n)\\frac{P}{P^f}\\), the future budget constraint can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nC^f = Y^f  - T^f + (1+r)S + \\frac{(1+r)M}{(1+r_n)P}\n\\tag{3.23}\\]\nFinally, the two budget constraints can be combined to yield an intertemporal budget constraint:\n\\[\nC^f = (Y-C-T)(1+r)+Y^f -T^f - \\frac{r_nM}{(1+r_n)P}.\n\\tag{3.24}\\]\nSubstituting the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, the household’s intertemporal budget constraint can also be written as:\n\\[\nC^f = (Y-C-G)(1+r)+Y^f -G^f - \\frac{r_nM}{(1+r_n)P}\n\\tag{3.25}\\]\nThe fact that current and future tax payments are now replaced by current and future government spending means that it does not matter for the real economy how government spending is financed: the private sector will react to expenditures that are financed out of debt in the same way it reacts to expenditures financed out of taxation. This result is also known as Ricardian Equivalence. Put differently, Ricardian Equivalence means the household behaves as if the government balances its budget in every period.\nWith these ingredients, the household’s optimisation problem can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\max _{C, N, M} & U=\\ln (C)+b_1 \\ln (1-N)+b_2 \\ln \\left(C^f\\right)+b_3 \\ln \\left(\\frac{M}{P}\\right), \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & C^f=(Y-C-G)(1+r)+Y^f-G^f-\\frac{r_n M}{\\left(1+r_n\\right) P} .\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nSubstituting the constraint Equation 3.25 for \\(C^f\\) in the utility function allows to obtain the following first-order conditions:\n\\[\nC-\\frac{C^f}{b_2(1+r)}=0\n\\tag{3.26}\\]\n\\[\nN+\\frac{b_1 C^f}{b_2(1+r) w}-1=0\n\\tag{3.27}\\]\n\\[\nM-\\frac{b_3 C^f\\left(1+r_n\\right) P}{b_2(1+r) r_n}=0 .\n\\tag{3.28}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 3.26, which is often also called the Euler equation, into Equation 3.27 and Equation 3.28 yields Equation 6.12 for labour supply and Equation 3.10 for money demand, respectively. Finally, using Equation 3.25 and Equation 3.28 in the Euler Equation 3.26 yields the consumption function Equation 5.2."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe IS-LM model was developed by John R. Hicks (1937) to formalise some key ideas of John Maynard Keynes’ 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. The model contains two equilibrium relationships: a goods market equilibrium between investment and saving (IS) and a money market equilibrium between money demand and money supply (LM). In the goods market, aggregate supply adjusts to the level of aggregate demand given by the expenditure decisions of households, firms, and the government. Households form their consumption demand based on a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income. Firms take investment decisions based on the rate of interest. Money demand is determined by aggregate income (transactions demand) and the interest rate on bonds (speculative demand). The money supply is assumed to be exogenous and under the control of the central bank. The two markets pin down equilibrium output and the interest rate. The goods market equilibrium may well coincide with involuntary unemployment. Adverse shocks to autonomous investment (‘animal spirits’) or autonomous money demand (‘liquidity preference’) reduce output and raise unemployment. The government can use monetary policy, fiscal spending, and income taxes to stimulate economic activity and achieve full employment.\nIn this short-run model, prices and the capital stock are fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. As all endogenous variables adjust instantaneously, the model is static. We consider a version with linear functions, adapted from Blanchard and Johnson (2013, chap. 5)."

Investment demand in Equation 4.3 has an autonomous component \\(\\left(i_{0}\\right)\\) capturing Keynesian animal spirits and a component that is negatively related to the rate of interest on bonds. By equations Equation 4.4 and Equation 4.5, government spending and taxation are exogenous. Similarly, the money supply in Equation 4.6 is assumed to be exogenous. By Equation 4.7, households’ money demand is positively related to income (capturing the transaction demand for money) and negatively related to the interest rate on bonds (capturing speculative demand).

A fall in animal spirits (scenario 2) and an increase in liquidity preference (scenario 3) both have contractionary effects. While the fall in animal spirits directly reduces aggregate demand and thereby output (despite a fall in the interest rate), the rise in liquidity preference depresses output through its positive effect on the interest rate. Both scenarios raise the unemployment rate (Figure 4.3). Scenarios 4 to 6 assess three different macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate output. It can be seen in Figure 4.1 that fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy for the parameterisation in Table 1.1 Direct fiscal stimulus is more effective than tax cuts due to the constant marginal propensity to consume. The effect on output is a multiple of the one-unit stimulus thanks to the multiplier effect. However, it can also be seen that fiscal policy raises the interest rate, which crowds out some of the expansionary effect.\n\nbarplot(Y_star, ylab=\"Y\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Output\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(r_star, ylab=\"r\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Interest rate\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(U_star*100, ylab=\"U (%)\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                              \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Unemployment\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 further show that monetary policy mostly stimulates investment, whereas fiscal policy boost consumption.\n\nbarplot(I_star, ylab=\"I\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Investment\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(C_star, ylab=\"C\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n# barplot(N_star, ylab=\"N\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n#                                       \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"))\n\nCalculate equilibrium fiscal multiplier\n\nY_star[6]-Y_star[1] # numerical approach\n\n[1] 2.222222\n\nm2/((1-c1)*m2+i1*m1) # analytical approach\n\n[1] 2.222222"

    "title": "5  A Neoclassical Synthesis Model (IS-LM-AS-AD)",
    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe Neoclassical Synthesis was developed in the 1940s and 1950s by Franco Modigliani, Paul Samuelson and others. It introduced neoclassical components into the Keynesian IS-LM model that had been proposed by John R. Hicks (1937) to formalise some key ideas of John Maynard Keynes’ 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. The IS-LM model, which is analysed in detail in Chapter 4, contains two equilibrium relationships: a goods market equilibrium between investment and saving (IS) and a money market equilibrium between money demand and money supply (LM). In the goods market, aggregate supply adjusts to the level of aggregate demand given by the expenditure decisions of households, firms, and the government. Money demand is determined by aggregate income and the interest rate on bonds. The money supply is assumed to be exogenous. The two markets pin down equilibrium output and the interest rate.\nThe Neoclassical Synthesis adds a neoclassical labour market with Keynesian frictions to the IS-LM model. Following the discussion in Froyen (2005), chap. 9, we consider a labour market in which firms have perfect information about the real wage, whereas workers need to form expectations about the price level. Price expectations are assumed to be exogenous in the short run. Workers thus suffer from `money illusion’: an increase in the actual price levels reduces the real wage but leaves their labour supply unchanged. This gives rise to an upward-sloping aggregate supply (AS) (or Phillips) curve. By contrast, the aggregate demand (AD) curve is downward-sloping as a higher price level increases the demand for real money balances, which pushes up the interest rate.\nIn this short-run model, prices are flexible but the capital stock is fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. As all endogenous variables adjust instantaneously, the model is static. We consider a version with a Cobb-Douglass production function and otherwise linear behavioural functions, based on the graphical analysis in Froyen (2005), chap. 9."

Aggregate supply (\\(Y\\)) accommodates to the level of aggregate demand which is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending. Equation 5.2 is the consumption function consisting of autonomous consumption demand (\\(c_0\\)) and a marginal propensity to consume (\\(c_1\\)) out of disposable income (\\(Y-T_0\\)). Investment demand in Equation 5.3 has an autonomous component (\\(i_0\\)) capturing Keynesian animal spirits and a component that is negatively related to the rate of interest on bonds. Government spending and taxation are exogenous. Similarly, the nominal money supply (\\(M_0\\)) in Equation 5.4 is assumed to be exogenous. By Equation 5.5, households’ real money demand is positively related to income (capturing the transaction demand for money) and negatively related to the interest rate on bonds (capturing speculative demand). There is also an autonomous term (\\(m_0\\)) capturing Keynesian liquidity preference. Equilibrium in the money market Equation 5.6 yields an equation for the interest rate.\nIn Equation 6.11, the real wage is determined by the marginal product of labour implied by a Cobb-Douglass production function (\\(Y=AK^aN^{1-a}\\)). This means the real wage is always consistent with firms’ demand for labour based on profit-maximisation.1 Equation 6.10 specifies the nominal wage as implied by households’ labour supply curve. Optimising households supply labour based on their work-leisure trade-off (with the parameter \\(b\\) capturing their preference for leisure, \\(1-\\frac{N}{N^f}\\)). Since they don’t have knowledge of the current real wage, they base their decisions on the expected price level \\(P^e\\), which is exogenous in the short run. The actual price level is then given by the ratio of the nominal wage to the real wage Equation 6.9. In other words, firms set prices such that the nominal wage they pay to workers are consistent with their own desired real wage. Equation 6.12 pins down employment as implied by the Cobb-Douglass production function. In conjunction with an exogenously given labour force \\(N^f\\) (or total available labour time), the level of employment can be used to obtain an unemployment rate in Equation 6.13."

A fall in animal spirits (scenario 2) reduces aggregate demand and thereby output and employment (despite a fall in the interest rate). This reduces workers’ nominal wage demands and thus the price level. An increase in productivity (scenario 3) has expansionary effects on output but adverse effects on employment. Higher productivity means that fewer workers need to be hired to produce the same level of output. However, the corresponding reduction in employment also reduces the price level, which lowers the (real) demand for money and thus lowers the interest rate. This has expansionary effects on output.\n\nbarplot(Y_star, ylab=\"Y\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise product.\",\n                                      \"4:Rise exp. price\", \"5:Monetary expan.\", \"6:Fiscal expan.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Output\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(P_star, ylab=\"P\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise product.\",\n                                      \"4:Rise exp. price\", \"5:Monetary expan.\", \"6:Fiscal expan.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Price level\n\n\n\n\n\nbarplot(r_star, ylab=\"r\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise product.\",\n                                      \"4:Rise exp. price\", \"5:Monetary expan.\", \"6:Fiscal expan.\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Interest rate\n\n\n\n\nA rise in the expected price level (scenario 4) raises nominal wages and thereby the actual price level.

All other variables are endogenous and form a closed loop (or cycle) within the system. The lower-left part of the graph captures the goods market (IS): aggregate demand (consumption, investment, and government spending) determines output. The upper part of the graph contains the labour market, which determines the price level. Finally, the lower-right part of the graph represents the money market (LM), which determines the interest rate. There is a two-way feedback between the goods market and the money market as output impacts the demand for money, and the interest rate affects investment. There is also a feedback from output into the labour market through employment. The labour market feeds into the money market via its effect on prices and thus money demand, which then also feeds into the goods market through the interest rate."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nPost-Keynesian Economics is an economic paradigm that was developed in the 1930s and 1940s by Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor and others.1 The early post-Keynesian economists sought to develop further key ideas of John Maynard Keynes. They were critical of the Neoclassical Synthesis that introduced neoclassical elements into the Keynesian framework. Among many other points, post-Keynesians argued that money is created by commercial banks. Money creation is determined by the demand for credit rather than being under the control of the central bank, and should thus be considered endogenous. Post-Keynesians further assigned a key role to financial factors in the determination of economic activity, but also considered finance as a source of instability. They abandoned the neoclassical approach of deriving labour demand and supply from optimising behaviour and instead assumed oligopolistic market structures. Firms set prices by charging a mark-up on costs and workers set nominal wages based on their bargaining power.\nFontana and Setterfield (2009) present a simple model that could be regarded as a post-Keynesian alternative to the Neoclassical Synthesis. The model highlights the endogenous money creation process. Money is being created when commercial banks make loans to accommodate the demand for credit by creditworthy borrowers. The demand for credit is driven by aggregate demand. The interest rate on loans is determined by the base rate, set by the central bank, on which commercial banks charge a mark-up. Although credit creation is demand-driven, some borrowers will be credit constrained. In times of financial crises, banks tighten credit constraints, which can depress economic activity.\nIn this short-run model, prices are flexible but the capital stock is fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. As all endogenous variables adjust instantaneously, the model is static. We consider a version of the model due to Fontana and Setterfield (2009) with linear functions."

Aggregate supply (\\(Y\\)) accommodates to the level of aggregate demand which is the sum of a not debt-financed component (\\(ND\\)) and a (desired) debt-financed component (\\(D\\)). The coefficient \\(c\\) is the proportion of loan applications that are deemed creditworthy and thus captures credit rationing by banks. By Equation 6.2, the not debt-financed component of aggregate demand is a function of current income. In Equation 6.3, the debt-financed component of aggregate demand has an autonomous component (\\(d_0\\))2 and is otherwise negatively related to the lending rate \\(r\\). Equation 6.4 specifies the monetary policy rule, where it is assumed that the central bank raises the policy rate \\(i\\) when the price level increases.^[This specification is somewhat unrealistic given that most modern central banks target a positive rate of inflation. However, it allows for an AS-AD representation of the model, which facilitates the comparison with the Neoclassical Synthesis model (Chapter 5) The lending rate in Equation 7.1 is given by a mark-up \\(m\\) that banks charge on the policy rate (which is the rate at which they can borrow reserves). The change in loans in Equation 6.6 is equal to the creditworthy demand for loans (\\(cD\\)). This captures the demand-driven nature of credit creation. The changes in loans translates one-to-one into a change in money, which are bank deposits in this model (Equation 6.7). This reflects the endogenous money creation process where commercial banks create new deposits when they make new loans. By Equation 6.8, banks obtain new reserves from the central bank to maintain a constant reserve-to-deposit ratio \\(k\\). Thus, the causality in this model runs from debt-financed demand to loans, to deposits, and finally to reserves.\nBy Equation 6.9, the price level is set by firms based on a mark-up (\\(n\\)) on unit labour cost (which are the product of the nominal wage \\(W\\) and the labour coefficient \\(a\\)). Nominal wages are set by workers based on their bargaining power, which is declining in the unemployment rate (Equation 6.13). The real wage in Equation 6.11 is derived from the pricing Equation 6.9, i.e. through their price setting power, firms ultimately determine the real wage. The level of employment in Equation 6.12 is determined residually based on economic activity and a constant-coefficient production function \\((Y=\\frac{N}{a})\\). Finally, the level of employment in conjunction with an exogenously given labour force \\(N^f\\) (or total available labour time) can be used to obtain an unemployment rate in Equation 6.13."

Bank reserves are a residual. The lower-left part of the graph represents the labour market. The goods market feeds into the labour market via employment, which determines nominal wages and the price level. The real wage is a residual. The price level feeds into interest rate determination in the upper part of the model, which establishes a causal feedback link from the labour market to the goods market."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe post-Kaleckian growth model was developed by Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) and others to synthesise Marxian and Keynesian ideas about the effects of income distribution on economic growth.1 According to the Marxian view, capital accumulation is driven by profits. By contrast, Michal Kalecki and post-Keynesians such as Nicholas Kaldor argued that a redistribution of income towards profit-earners is likely to reduce consumption, as workers tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume than capital owners. The post-Kaleckian growth model integrates these two mechanisms in a Keynesian framework in which aggregate demand and growth are demand-determined. It allows for wage-led as well as profit-led demand and growth regimes. In a wage-led regime, a redistribution of income towards workers has expansionary effects on aggregate demand (and possibly growth) as the expansionary effect on consumption outweighs the negative effect on investment. In a profit-led regime, the effect is contradictory as investment falls by more than consumption rises. Whether a regime is wage- or profit-led depends on the relative size of the propensities to consume and the propensity to invest.\nThis is a model of long-run steady state growth. In the steady state, all endogenous variables grow at the same rate.2 Changes in parameters or exogenous variables lead to an instantaneous adjustment of the model’s variables, so that the model can be analysed like a static one. We consider a version of the model with linear functions based on Hein (2014), chap. 7.2.2."

Let \\(Y\\) be output, \\(K\\) be the capital stock, and \\(Y^P\\) be potential output, the decomposition can also be written as \\(r=\\frac{\\Pi}{K}=\\frac{\\Pi}{Y}\\frac{Y}{Y^P}\\frac{Y^P}{K}\\). The profit share and the capital-potential output ratio are taken to be exogenous in this model. Note also that the wage share is given by \\(1-h\\). By Equation 7.2, the economy-wide saving rate is given by the sum of saving out of wages (\\(s_W(1-h)\\frac{u}{v}\\)) and saving out of profits (\\(s_\\Pi h\\frac{u}{v}\\)). It is assumed that workers have a higher marginal propensity to consume than capital owners (\\(s_W&gt;s_\\Pi\\)). Equation 7.3 simply states that consumption is income not saved. According to Equation 7.3, investment is determined by an autonomous component \\(g_0\\) that may capture Keynesian `animal spirits’, by the rate of capacity utilisation, and by the profit share. While the rate of capacity utilisation is a signal of (future) demand, the profit share may stimulate investment as internal funds are typically the cheapest source of finance. Finally, Equation 7.5 is an equilibrium condition that assumes that the rate of capacity utilisation adjusts to clear the goods market.\nThe key question addressed by this model is a how a change in the profit share affects the rate of capacity utilisation and the rate of growth.3 As shown formally in the analytical discussion below, there is no unambiguous answer to this question as the model encompasses different regimes. Three main regimes can be identified. First, a regime in which both the rate of utilisation and the rate of growth are negatively affected by an increase in the profit share. We will call this a wage-led demand and growth regime (WLD/WLG). Second, a regime in which the rate of utilisation is negatively affected and the rate of growth is positively affected by an increase in the profit share. We will call this a wage-led demand regime and profit-led growth regime (WLD/PLG). Third, a regime in which both the rate of utilisation and the rate of growth are positively affected by an increase in the profit share. We will call this a profit-led demand and growth regime (PLD/PLG)."

The rise in the profit share reduces consumption and the rate of utilisation, but the ultimate effect on investment is positive because investment reacts more strongly to the rise in the profit share than to the fall in demand.\n\nbarplot(g_star, ylab=\"g\", names.arg=c(\"1:baseline WLD/WLG\", \"2:rise prof share\", \"3:baseline WLD/PLG\",\n                                      \"4:rise prof share\", \n                                      \"5:baseline PLD/PLG\", \"6: rise prof share\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Rate of growth\n\n\n\n\nFinally, in the third case where the demand regime and the growth regime are profit-led, investment is again equally sensitive to a change in the rate of capacity utilisation and to a change in the profit share, but now animal spirits are negative.

This method consists of substituting a trial solution that contains undetermined coefficients into the difference equation and then attempting to solve for those coefficients. If the trial solution allows to pin down unique values for the coefficients, it constitute a valid particular solution.\nIn the case above where \\(a_1 \\neq 1\\), we could have used the trial solution \\(y_t=y_{t-1}=y^*\\) and then solve for \\(y\\) to obtain \\(\\frac{a_0}{1-a}\\) as the particular solution. In the case where \\(a_1=1\\) and \\(a_0 \\neq 0\\), we can use the trial solution \\(y^*=kt\\), which is a growing equilibrium. This yields \\(y_t = k(t-1) + a_0\\), which solves for \\(k=a_0\\), so that we can conclude \\(y^*=a_0t\\). This explains why we obtain linear growth. If \\(a_1=1\\) and \\(a_0 =0\\), we have \\(y_t=y_{t-1}\\), so that the equilibrium is given by the initial condition \\(y_0\\)."

    "text": "Solution of a linear system of difference equations\nThe solution approach just introduced can be extended to \\(N\\)-dimensional systems of linear difference equations of the form:\n\\[\ny_t=a_0 + Ay_{t-1},  \n\\]\nwhere \\(y_t\\) is a \\(1 \\times N\\) column vector and \\(A\\) an \\(N \\times N\\) square matrix.\nIf the inverse \\((I-A)^{-1}\\) exists, which requires \\(det(I-A) \\neq 0\\), the solution will be of the form:\n\\[\ny_t= (I-A)^{-1}a_0 + A^t[y_0- (I-A)^{-1}a_0].\n\\]\nThe problem with this generic solution is that it is difficult to assess what is going on: the dynamics of any variable in \\(y_t\\) will depend on a lengthy combination of the parameters in \\(A\\) that result from repeated matrix multiplication (\\(A^t=A\\times A\\times A\\times A...\\)). This makes it is impossible to assess whether the system converges to the particular solution. To address this problem, we can use a tool from linear algebra called matrix diagonalisation. Under certain conditions, a matrix \\(A\\) can be decomposed into the product of three matrices in which the matrix in the middle is diagonal. As we will see, this trick has a useful application to our problem.\nA matrix \\(A\\) is diagonalisable if there is a diagonal matrix \\(D\\) and an invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A=PDP^{-1}\\). A major advantage of this decomposition is the following property: \\(A^n = (PDP^{-1})^n = PD^nP^{-1}\\).2 Thus, the \\(nth\\) power of the matrix \\(A\\), which typically yields very cumbersome expressions, simplifies to \\(PD^nP^{-1}\\), where the \\(nth\\) power of \\(D\\) is simply applied to each individual element on the main diagonal thanks to \\(D\\) being a diagonal matrix. As a result, diagonalisation allows us to write the complementary function in the solution to a system of difference equations as: \\(PD^tP^{-1}y_0\\). We can further define a vector of arbitrary constants \\(c=P^{-1}y_0\\) so that the complementary function becomes \\(PD^tc\\). For the first variable in the system, the solution would then take the form:\n\\[\ny_{1t}=v_{11}c_1\\lambda_1^t+v_{12}c_2\\lambda_2^t + ...+ y_1^*,\n\\]\nwhere \\(v_j\\) are the column vectors of \\(P\\) and \\(\\lambda_i\\) are the elements on the main diagonal of \\(D\\). The \\(v_j\\) are called the eigenvectors of the matrix \\(A\\) and the \\(\\lambda_i\\) are its eigenvalues (more about them in a second). From this representation of the solution, the nature of the dynamics can easily be determined by looking at the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) that is largest in absolute terms. This is also called the ‘dominant eigenvalue’. Only if the dominant eigenvalue is \\(|\\lambda|&lt;1\\) will the system converge to \\(y^*\\). The elements \\(v_{ij}\\) of the eigenvectors act as multipliers on the eigenvalues and can thus switch off certain eigenvalues (if they happen to be zero) or amplify their dynamics both into the positive and negative domain (depending on their algebraic sign).\nHow can the diagonal matrix \\(D\\) be found? Notice that \\(AP=PD\\) can also be written as \\(Av=\\lambda v\\). We can then write \\(v(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We want to find the solutions of this linear system other than \\(v = 0\\) (we don’t want the eigenvectors to be zero vectors, otherwise the solution to the dynamic system presented above wouldn’t work). This requires the determinant of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\) to become zero, i.e. \\(det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). Note that then there will be an infinite number of solutions for the eigenvectors.\nLet’s consider an example. Let \\(a_0=0\\) for simplicity, so that the dynamic system is \\(y_t = Ay_{t-1}\\). Let the matrix \\(A\\) be given by: \\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}7 & -15 \\\\ 2 & -4 \\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nThen\n\\[A-\\lambda I =\\begin{bmatrix}7 - \\lambda & -15 \\\\ 2 & -4 - \\lambda \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nand\n\\[det(A-\\lambda I)=(7-\\lambda)(-4-\\lambda)+30=\\lambda^2 - 3\\lambda +2=0.\\]\nThis second-order polynomial solves for \\(\\lambda_1=2\\) and \\(\\lambda_2=1\\), which will be the elements on the diagonal of \\(D\\).\nTo find \\(v_j\\), substitute the \\(\\lambda_i\\) into \\(v_j(A-\\lambda_iI)=0\\). For \\(\\lambda_1=2\\), we get \\(5v_{11}- 15v_{21}=0\\) and \\(2v_{11}- 6v_{21}=0\\), yielding the eigenvector \\(v_1=\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}\\). However, any scalar multiple of this eigenvector (other than zero) is admissible. It is thus common to normalise the eigenvectors by dividing through one of its elements. Dividing through by the first element yields the normalised eigenvector \\(v_1=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} \\end{bmatrix}\\).\nFor \\(\\lambda_2=1\\), this yields \\(6v_{12}- 15v_{22}=0\\) and \\(2v_{12}-5v_{22}=0\\) from which we can deduce that \\(v_2=\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix}\\). The normalised eigenvector is \\(v_2=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0.4 \\end{bmatrix}\\).\nOf course, you can also perform these calculations in R:\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n## Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix\n# Define matrix\nJ=matrix(c(7, -15,\n           2, -4), 2, 2, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nev=eigen(J)\n(evals = ev$values)\n\n[1] 2 1\n\n(evecs = ev$vector)\n\n          [,1]      [,2]\n[1,] 0.9486833 0.9284767\n[2,] 0.3162278 0.3713907\n\n# Normalise eigenvectors by dividing through by the first element\nevecs_norm=evecs\nfor (i in 1:2){\n  evecs_norm[,i]=evecs[,i]/evecs[1,i]\n}\nevecs_norm\n\n          [,1] [,2]\n[1,] 1.0000000  1.0\n[2,] 0.3333333  0.4\n\n\nWe can now use this solution for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues to write the solution of the dynamic system as:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} y_{1t} \\\\ y_{2t} \\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} & 0.4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^t \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} & 0.4 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\begin{bmatrix} y_{10} \\\\ y_{20} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} & 0.4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^t \\begin{bmatrix} c_{1} \\\\ c_{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nMultiplying the matrices out yields:\n\\[\ny_{1t} = c_{1}2^t + c_{2}1^t\n\\]\n\\[\ny_{2t} = \\frac{1}{3}c_{1}2^t + 0.4c_{2}1^t.\n\\]\nBefore comparing these analytical results with those from a numerical simulation, let’s summarise the information we gain from the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and arbitrary constants about the dynamics of the system:\n\nsince the dominant eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_1=2\\) is larger than one, we know that the system is unstable\nsince both elements in the dominant eigenvector \\(v_1=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} \\end{bmatrix}\\) are non-zero, both variables in the system will be driven by that dominant eigenvalue\nsince both elements in the dominant eigenvector are positive but the arbitrary constant \\(c_1\\) is negative for positive initial conditions (see below), both variables will decay\nsince both variables will decay at the same rate, their ratio will be constant as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and will approach a value that is given by the ratio of the elements in the dominant eigenvector\n\nTo see the last point, observe that in \\(\\frac{y_{2t}}{y_{1t}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}c_{1}2^t + 0.4c_{2}1^t}{c_{1}2^t + c_{2}1^t}\\) the first terms in the numerator and denominator, respectively, quickly dominate the second terms as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\) (you can show this formally using L’Hopital’s rule). Thus, \\(\\frac{y_{2t}}{y_{1t}}\\) will approach \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nLet us simulate the system and compare the results for, say, \\(t=10\\) with the analytical solution:\n\n# Set number of periods for which you want to simulate\nT=100\n\n# Construct matrices in which values for different periods will be stored; initialise at 1\ny1=matrix(data=1, nrow=1, ncol=T)\ny2=matrix(data=1, nrow=1, ncol=T)\n\n#Solve this system recursively based on the initialisation\n  for (t in 2:T){\n    y1[,t] = J[1,1]*y1[, t-1] + J[1,2]*y2[, t-1]\n    y2[,t] = J[2,1]*y1[, t-1] + J[2,2]*y2[, t-1]\n} # close time loop\n\n# Plot dynamics of y1\nplot(y1[1, 1:15],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"Time\", ylab=\"y1\") \ntitle(main=\"\", cex=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Find arbitrary constants: c=(P^-1)*y0\nlibrary(matlib)\ny0=c(y1[1,1],y2[1,1])  # create vector with initial conditions y0\nc=inv(evecs_norm)%*%y0\nc\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]   -9\n[2,]   10\n\n## Compute solution manually for y2 at t=10 and compare with simulated solution\nt=10\nevecs_norm[2,1]*c[1,1]*evals[1]^t + evecs_norm[2,1]*c[2,1]*evals[2]^t # analytical solution\n\n[1] -3068.667\n\ny2[,t+1] # simulated solution\n\n[1] -3068\n\n# Plot dynamics of y2/y1\ny2_y1=y2/y1\nplot(y2_y1[, 1:50],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"Time\", ylab=\"y2/y1\")\ntitle(main=\"\", cex=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Compare y2/y1 with normalised dominant eigenvector\ny2_y1[,T]\n\n[1] 0.3333333\n\nevecs_norm[2,1]\n\n[1] 0.3333333\n\n\nIt can be seen that the simulated results are equivalent to the results we obtained analytically. The key takeaway is that by deriving information about the eigenvalues (and possibly eigenvectors) of the Jacobian matrix of the system, we are able to deduce knowledge of the dynamic properties of the system even without numerical simulation. However, the more complex the dynamic system, the more difficult this will be, thereby rendering numerical simulation a key tool to supplement formal analysis."

    "text": "Complex eigenvalues and cycles\nSo far, we have discussed the case where the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) are real numbers. However, what if the polynomial \\(det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\) does not yield real numbers? Recall that in the case of a second-order polynomial \\(\\lambda^2+b\\lambda+c=0\\), the two roots are given by \\(\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}\\). If the term under the root \\(\\Delta=b^2-4c\\), also called discriminant, becomes negative, the solution will be a complex number. More specifically, we can write:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{4c-b^2}\\sqrt{-1}}{2} =\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{4c-b^2}i}{2},\n\\]\nwhere \\(i=\\sqrt{-1}\\) is the imaginary number. The expression can also be written as:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,2} = h \\pm mi,\n\\]\nwhich is a pair of conjugate complex numbers containing a real part given by \\(h\\) and an imaginary part given by \\(m\\).\nConsider the model by Samuelson (1939) discussed in Chapter 2: \\[\nC_t= c_1(C_{t-1} + I_{t-1} + G_0)\n\\]\n\\[\nI_t= \\beta[c_1(C_{t-1} + I_{t-1} + G_0) - C_{t-1}]\n\\]\nThe Jacobian matrix of this model is given by:\n\\[\nJ=\\begin{bmatrix} c_1 & c_1 \\\\ \\beta(c_1-1) & \\beta c_1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe characteristic polynomial yielding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian is\n\\[\\lambda^2-\\lambda c_1(1+\\beta)+\\beta c_1=0.\\]\nThus we have\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{c_1(1+\\beta) \\pm \\sqrt{[c_1(1+\\beta)]^2-4\\beta c_1}}{2}.\n\\]\nThus, the two eigenvalues will be a pair of complex conjugates if \\([c_1(1+\\beta)]^2+4\\beta c_1 &lt;0\\). Suppose we have \\(c_1=0.4\\) and \\(\\beta=2\\). Then the discriminant will be negative and the eigenvalues will be complex:\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set parameter values\nc1=0.4\nbeta=2\n\n# Check if discriminant is negative\n(c1*(1+beta))^2-4*c1*beta\n\n[1] -1.76\n\n## Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix\n# Define matrix\nJ=matrix(c(c1, c1,\n           beta*(c1-1), beta*c1), \n           2, 2, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nev=eigen(J)\n(evals = ev$values)\n\n[1] 0.6+0.663325i 0.6-0.663325i\n\n\nAnother way of understanding the logic behind complex numbers is through a so-called Argand diagram that plots the real part of the eigenvalue on the horizontal and the imaginary part on the vertical axis. By Pythagoras’ theorem, the distance of the eigenvalue from the origin will then be given by \\(R=\\sqrt{h^2+m^2}\\). The value of \\(R\\) (which is always real-valued and positive) is called the modulus (or absolute value) of the complex eigenvalue and will contain important information about the dynamic stability of economic models that exhibit complex eigenvalues.\n\n### Draw Argand diagram\n\n# Save real and imaginary part of complex eigenvalue\nre=Re(evals[1])\nim=Im(evals[1])\n\n# Plot complex eigenvalue\npar(bty=\"l\")\nplot(re,im, type=\"o\", xlim=c(0, 1), ylim=c(0, 1), lwd=2, xlab=\"h\", ylab=\"m\", main=\"Argand diagram of complex eigenvalue\")\n\n# Plot unit circle\nX=seq(0, 1, by=0.001)\nY = sqrt(1 - X^2) \nlines(X,Y, type=\"l\", lty=\"dotted\")\n\n# Plot a ray from the origin to eigenvalue\nsegments(0,0,re,im, lty='solid')\n\n# Add labels\ntext(0.1, 0.025, expression(theta), cex=1)\ntext(0.1, 0.25, expression(R==sqrt(h^2+m^2)), cex=1)\ntext(re, im+0.05, expression(lambda==h+mi), cex=1)\n\n\n\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) of the line that connects the origin and the complex eigenvalue and the x-axis of the Argand diagram also contains information about the dynamics. To see this, note that the geometry of the complex number represented in the Argand diagram can also be expressed in trigonometric form: \\[\n\\sin\\theta=\\frac{m}{R}\n\\] \\[\n\\cos\\theta=\\frac{h}{R},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta=\\arcsin (\\frac{m}{R}) =\\arccos (\\frac{h}{R})=\\arctan(\\frac{m}{h})\\)\nThus, we can write the complex eigenvalue also as:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,2}=R(\\cos\\theta \\pm \\sin\\theta \\times i).\n\\]\nBy De Moivre’s theorem, we have \\((\\cos\\theta \\pm \\sin\\theta \\times i)^t=(\\cos\\theta t \\pm \\sin\\theta t \\times i)\\). Thus, the solution to a dynamic system that exhibits complex eigenvalues will be of the form:\n\\[\ny_{1t}=v_{11}c_1 R_1^t(\\cos\\theta_1 t \\pm \\sin\\theta_1 t \\times i) +...+ y^*_1.\n\\]\nFrom this solution we can again deduce key information about the dynamics of the system based on the (complex) eigenvalues:\n\nstability will depend on the modulus: for \\(R&lt;\\) the system will be stable, for \\(R&gt;1\\) it will be unstable\nfrom the nature of the trigonometric functions \\(\\sin(\\theta t)\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta t)\\), we know that system will exhibit periodic cyclical dynamics as \\(t\\) increases\nthe length of the cycles will be given by \\(L=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\theta}\\) and the frequency by \\(F=1/L=\\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}\\)\n\nthe amplitude of the cycles will depend on the elements of the eigenvectors, the initial conditions, and \\(R\\).\n\nLet us simulate the Samuelson model with the parameterisation that yields complex eigenvalues to illustrate these results:\n\n# Calculate modulus\nmod=Mod(evals[1])\nmod\n\n[1] 0.8944272\n\n# Calculate cycle length\nL=(2*pi)/(acos(re/mod))\nL\n\n[1] 7.520433\n\n# Set number of periods for which you want to simulate\nT=100\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=1\n\n# Construct matrices in which values for different periods will be stored; initialise at 1\nC=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=T)\nI=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=T)\n\n#Construct matrices for exogenous variable\nG0=matrix(data=5, nrow=S, ncol=T)\n\n#Solve this system recursively based on the initialisation\nfor (t in 2:T){\n    C[1,t] = c1*(C[1,t-1] + I[1,t-1] + G0[1,t-1])\n    I[1,t] = beta*(c1*(C[1,t-1] + I[1,t-1] + G0[1,t-1]) - C[1,t-1])\n  } # close t1me loop\n\n# Calculate output\nY=C+G0+I\n\n# Time series chart of output dynamics in Samuelson (1939) model\nplot(Y[1, 1:30],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"Time\", ylab=\"Y\") \ntitle(main=\"Figure 1: Output\", cex=0.8)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the model generates cycles with a length (from peak/trough to peak/trough) of around 7.5 periods. Since the modulus is \\(R&lt;1\\), the system is stable and eventually converges to the equilibrium."

    "text": "Overview\nNew Keynesian dynamic general equilibrium models were developed in the 1990s and 2000s to guide monetary policy.1 They build on real business cycle models with rational expectations but introduce Keynesian frictions such as imperfect competition and nominal rigidities. While the structural forms of these models are typically complex as behavioural functions are derived from the intertemporal optimisation, the reduced-form of the benchmark models can be represented by three main equations: (i) an IS curve, (ii) a Phillips curve, (iii) and an interest rate rule.\nThe IS curve establishes a negative relationship between real income and the real interest rate. For a higher real interest rate, households will save more and thus consume less. The Phillips curve models inflation as a function of the output gap. A positive output gap (an economic expansion) leads to higher inflation. The monetary policy rule specifies how the central bank reacts to deviations of actual inflation from a politically determined inflation target.\nThe simplified version of the 3-equation model we consider here is directly taken from chapter 4 of Carlin and Soskice (2014). This is a short-run model in which prices are flexible but the capital stock is fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. In the Carlin-Soskice version, inflation expectations are assumed to be adaptive and the response of aggregate demand to a change in the interest rate is sluggish. This renders the model dynamic.2"

Aggregate output adjusts to the level of aggregate demand, which is given by autonomous demand (times the multiplier) and a component that is negatively related to the (lagged) real interest rate via households’ saving (\\(a_1&gt;0\\)). Equation 9.2 is the Phillips curve. It is assumed that inflation is driven by adaptive expectations (\\(E[\\pi_{t+1}]=\\pi_{t-1}\\)) and positively related to the output gap \\((y_t-y_e)\\), i.e. \\(a_2&gt;0\\). By Equation 9.3, the stabilising real interest rate is that real interest rate that is consistent with equilibrium output (\\(y_e=A -a_1r_s\\)). Finally, the interest rate rule in Equation 9.4 specifies the real interest rate the central bank needs to set to minimise its loss function (see Section 9.5 below for a derivation). The parameter \\(a_3\\) is a composite one given by \\(a_3 = \\frac{1}{a_1(\\frac{1}{a_2 b} + a_2)} &gt;0\\). Although the central bank only sets the nominal interest rate $i = r + E[_{t+1}]$$ directly, the fact that expected inflation is predetermined in every period allows it to indirectly control the real interest rate."

A permanent rise in aggregate demand (scenario 1) has an instantaneous expansionary effect on output, but also pushes inflation above the target.

The central bank then gradually lowers the policy rate towards its new higher equilibrium value, where inflation is again stabilised at its target level.\n\n### Plot results\n\n### Plots\n# Set maximum period for plots\nTmax=15\n\n# Output under different scenarios\nplot(y[1, 1:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"\", xlim=range(2:(Tmax)), ylab=\"y\", ylim=range(y[1, 1:Tmax],y[3, 1:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 1: Output under different scenarios\", xlab = \"Time\",cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(y[2, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=2, lwd=2)\nlines(y[3, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=c(\"1: aggregate demand boost\", \"2: rise inflation target\", \"3: rise potential output\"), lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Inflation under different scenarios\nplot(p[1, 1:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"\", xlim=range(2:(Tmax)), ylab=expression(pi), ylim=range(p[1, 2:Tmax],p[3, 2:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 2: Inflation under different scenarios\", xlab = \"Time\",cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(p[2, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=2, lwd=2)\nlines(p[3, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=c(\"1: aggregate demand boost\", \"2: rise inflation target\", \"3: rise potential output\"), lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Policy rate under different scenarios\nplot(r[1, 2:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"\", xlim=range(1:(Tmax)), ylab=\"r\", ylim=range(r[1, 2:Tmax],r[3, 2:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 3: Policy rate under different scenarios\", xlab = \"Time\",cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(r[2, 2:(Tmax+1)],lty=2, lwd=2)\nlines(r[3, 2:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=c(\"1: aggregate demand boost\", \"2: rise inflation target\", \"3: rise potential output\"), lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n\nAn increase in the central bank’s inflation target (scenario 2) gradually raises the inflation rate to a new level.

    "text": "Analytical discussion\nDerivation of core equations\nIS curve\nThe IS curve in Equation 9.1 is loosely based on the consumption Euler equation introduced in Chapter 3. Suppose there are two periods and the household maximises its utility function \\(U=\\ln(C_t) + \\beta \\ln(C_{t+1})\\) subject to the intertemporal budget constraint \\(C_t+\\frac{C_{t+1}}{1+r}=Y_t + \\frac{Y_{t+1}}{1+r}\\). Substituting the constraint into the objective function and differentiating with respect to \\(C_t\\) yields the first-order condition:\n\\[\nC_t = \\frac{C_{t+1}}{\\beta(1+r)}.\n\\]\nThis consumption Euler equation establishes the negative relationship between the real interest rate and expenditures in Equation 9.1.\nPC curve\nThe Phillips curve Equation 9.2 is derived from wage- and price-setting in imperfect labour markets.3 Consider the following wage- and price-setting functions: \\[\n\\frac{W}{P^E} = B + \\alpha(y_t - y_e) + z_w\n\\] \\[\nP=(1+\\mu)\\frac{W}{\\lambda},\n\\tag{9.5}\\]\ni.e. the nominal wage \\(W\\), adjusted for the expected price level, is increasing in the output gap, a factor \\(B\\) capturing unemployment benefits and the disutility of work as well as a vector \\(z_w\\) of wage-push factors. Prices are set based on a constant mark-up (\\(\\mu\\)) on unit labour cost (\\(\\frac{W}{\\lambda}\\)).\nIn equilibrium, the real wage is given by: \\(w_e = B + z_w\\). In a dynamic setting, wage setters will raise the expected real wage by \\(\\left(\\frac{W_t}{P_{t}^E}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{W_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\\right)=\\alpha(y_t - y_e)\\). Together with adaptive expectations for prices \\(\\hat{P_t^E} = \\hat{P}_{t-1}\\) and the approximation \\(\\hat{W_t} - \\hat{P_{t-1}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{W_t}{P_{t}^E}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{W_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\\right)\\), this yields the following equation for wage inflation: \\[\n\\hat{W_t} = \\hat{P}_{t-1} +\\alpha(y_t - y_e).\n\\tag{9.6}\\]\nTransforming equation Equation 9.5 into growth rates (\\(\\hat{P}=\\hat{W}\\)) and combining it with the wage-inflation equation Equation 9.6 yields the Phillips curve Equation 9.2.\nMonetary policy rule\nFinally, to derive the interest rate rule, start from the following central bank loss function:4\n\\[\nL=(y_t-y_e)^2 + b(\\pi_t - \\pi^T)^2.\n\\] Substituting the Phillips curve (Equation 9.2) into the loss function, differentiating with respect to \\(y_t\\), and simplifying yields the first-order condition:\n\\[\ny_t-y_e = -a_2b(\\pi-\\pi^T),\n\\]\nwhich can also be regarded as a monetary policy rule. Next, substitute the Phillips curve (Equation 9.2), the IS-curve (Equation 9.1), and the stabilising interest rate (Equation 9.3) into the monetary policy rule and define \\(a_3 = \\frac{1}{a_1(\\frac{1}{a_2b} + a_2)}\\), which yields the interest rate rule (Equation 9.4).\nEquilibrium solutions and stability analysis\nBy definition, in the steady state we have \\(y^*=y_e\\). This implies that \\(r^*=r_s\\). From this, it follows that \\(\\pi^* = \\pi^T\\).\nTo analyse the dynamic stability of the model, we rewrite it as a system of first-order difference equations. To this end, substitute Equation 9.1 into Equation 9.2, which yields: \\[\n\\pi_t = \\pi_{t-1} + a_2(A - a_1r_{t-1}-y_e)\n\\tag{9.7}\\]\nSubstitute this equation into Equation 9.4, which yields: \\[\nr_t= r_{s} + a_3[\\pi_{t-1} + a_2(A - a_1r_{t-1}-y_e) - \\pi^T].\n\\tag{9.8}\\]\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system in Equation 9.1, Equation 9.7, and Equation 9.8 is given by: \\[\nJ=\\begin{bmatrix} 0& 0 &-a_1 \\\\0 & 1 & -a_1 a_2 \\\\ 0 & a_3 & -a_1 a_2 a_3 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] The eigenvalues of the Jacobian can be obtained from the characteristic polynomial \\(\\lambda^3 - Tr(J)\\lambda^2 + [Det(J_1) + Det(J_2) + Det(J_3)]\\lambda - Det(J) = 0\\), where \\(Tr(J)\\) and \\(Det(J\\)) are the trace and determinant, respectively, and \\(Det(J_i)\\) refers to the \\(i_{th}\\) principal minor of the matrix. As there is a column in the Jacobian that only contains zeros, it follows that the matrix is singular and will have a zero determinant. In addition, all principal minors turn out to be zero. The characteristic polynomial thus reduces to \\(\\lambda^2[\\lambda - Tr(J)]=0\\). From this, it is immediate that \\(\\lambda_{1,2}=0\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=Tr(J)\\), where \\(Tr(J)=1-a_1a_2a_3=\\frac{1}{1+a_2^2b}\\). Stability requires the single real eigenvalue to be smaller than unity (in absolute terms). With \\(\\lambda_3=\\frac{1}{1+a_2^2b}\\), stability thus only requires \\(a_2 \\neq 0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), i.e. the output gap needs to impact inflation (otherwise the key channel through which interest rate policy brings inflation back on target is blocked) and the central bank needs to assign a (non-negative) loss to deviations of actual inflation from its target.5\nWe can verify these analytical solutions by comparing them with the results from the numerical solution:\n\n# Construct Jacobian matrix \nJ=matrix(c(0,0,-a1,\n           0,1,-a1*a2,\n           0,a3,-a1*a2*a3), 3, 3, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Obtain eigenvalues\nev=eigen(J)\n(values &lt;- ev$values)\n\n[1] 0.6711409 0.0000000 0.0000000\n\n# Obtain determinant and trace\ndet(J)       # determinant\n\n[1] 0\n\nsum(diag(J)) # trace\n\n[1] 0.6711409"

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe Sraffian supermultiplier model was proposed by Serrano (1995) to integrate a Sraffian long-run equilibrium into a post-Keynesian growth model.1 The model requires the long-run rate of capacity utilisation to settle on an exogenously given normal rate. This requires investment to fully adjust to any changes in economic activity so as to bring back actual utilisation to the desired normal rate. As a result, investment expenditures (in the long-run) are assumed to be free of any idiosyncratic components such as Keynesian ‘animal spirits’. Long-run growth is then driven by those components of autonomous demand that do not create productive capacity – autonomous consumption in the simplest version of the model. An increase in the growth rate of autonomous consumption will stimulate economic activity and induce firms to adjust their expectations about long-run growth towards the new rate given by autonomous demand growth.\nIncome distribution is exogenous in this model. An increase in the wage share has an expansionary effect on economic activity and growth in the short-run as it increases consumption (investment is assumed to be independent of income distribution). However, this expansionary effect is only temporary as economic activity will eventually settle back on the normal rate of capacity utilisation, and the growth rate towards the rate given by autonomous demand growth. The absence of long-run effects of income distribution on output and growth constitutes a key difference between the Sraffian supermultiplier model and the post-Kaleckian model, in which there is no normal rate of capacity utilisation and no autonomous (non-capacity creating) demand.\nThis is a model of long-run steady state growth. In the steady state, all endogenous variables grow at the same rate.2 The model contains two state variables that determine the model’s dynamics: the ratio of autonomous demand to the capital stock (which changes during adjustment periods where the growth rate has not yet settled on the rate given by autonomous demand growth) and the expected growth rate of the capital stock, which sluggishly adjusts to the rate given by autonomous demand growth. We consider a continuous-time version of the model presented in chapter 6.5.8 of Lavoie (2022) .3"

By Equation 10.2, the economy-wide saving rate is given by the negative of the rate of autonomous demand (\\(z\\)), which in this version of the model is autonomous consumption, i.e. dissaving, and saving out of profits (\\(s_r\\)). It is assumed that workers do not save. Equation 10.3 simply states that consumption is income not saved. According to Equation 10.4, investment is determined by an autonomous component \\(g_0\\) that will be specified below and by the deviation of capacity utilisation from its normal rate \\(u_n\\). In other words, firms expand capacity whenever the actual rate of utilisation exceeds the desired normal rate. Equation 10.5 is the goods market equilibrium condition assuming that the rate of capacity utilisation adjusts to clear the goods market in the short run. Equation 10.6 is a key equation in the Sraffian supermultiplier approach, which posits that firms (sluggishly) adjust the expected growth rate to the actual growth rate. Finally, Equation 10.7 is an identity that traces changes in the rate of autonomous demand that stem from (temporary) mismatches between the exogenously given growth rate of autonomous demand (\\(g_z\\)) and the actual growth rate."

The profit rate (\\(r\\)), consumption (\\(c\\)), the autonomous demand rate (\\(z\\)), investment (\\(g\\)), the rate of utilisation (\\(u\\)), an the expected growth rate (\\(g_0\\)) form a closed loop (or cycle) within the system. For example, an increase in the growth rate of autonomous demand increases consumption, which raises the rate of capacity utilisation, growth, and the expected growth rate. In a second-round effect, the increase in the growth rate then feeds back negatively into the autonomous demand rate, which leads to a return of the rate of capacity utilisation to its previous value."

The theory revolves around the interaction between living standards and population growth.1 It assumes that birth rates increase with rising living standards, while death rates decline. Economic growth thus spurs population growth. However, due to supply constraints in agricultural production, population growth drives up food prices and thereby undermines real income, bringing population growth to a halt. The model is adapted from Karl Whelan’s lecture notes."

    "text": "Overview\nThis model captures some key feature of David Ricardo’s theory of growth and distribution as developed in his 1817 book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. The model revolves around the determination of real wages, rents, and profits, and how profitability in turn drives capital accumulation.1 It assumes a corn economy with a single good (corn) that serves both as an investment and consumption good.2 Corn production is subject to diminishing marginal returns. Real wages are driven down to a subsistence level and rent is a differential surplus landowners gain based on the fertility of their land relative to the marginal plot of land (the plot of land where fertility is lowest and no rent is earned). Profits are a residual. As employment increases and more land is utilised, marginal productivity falls and differential rents increase. As a result, profits are driven down and capital accumulation comes to a halt. A stationary state is reached. Landowners are the main beneficiaries of this process. The model is adapted from Pasinetti (1960)."

Equation 12.3 defines the real wage rate. Equation 12.3 specifies the marginal product of labour. Equation 12.5 captures the determination of (differential) rents as a negative function of the marginal product of labour.4 Thus, the lower the productivity on the marginal land, the higher the rents. In Equation 12.6, profits are determined residually. Capital accumulation in Equation 12.7 is driven by the reinvestment of profits (with \\(\\beta\\) determining the proportion of profits that are reinvested). Finally, Equation 12.8 specifies population dynamics, whereby the population increases whenever the actual real wage is above the subsistence wage, echoing the Malthusian population mechanism."

Starting from a below-equilibrium level of population, the economy grows in terms of output, capital, and employment but then approaches what Ricardo famously called a ‘stationary state’. Figure 2 shows that during the adjustment phase, the MPL declines reflecting diminishing marginal returns in the production of corn. This captures the idea that a growing economy will have to utilise less fertile lands. The real wage is initially below the MPL, allowing for profits. Over time, the MPL and actual real wage converge to the exogenously given subsistence wage. Figure 3 shows that profits initially increase but are then squeezed to zero as differential rents increase.\n\n# Set start and end periods for plots\nTmax=280\nTmin =10\n\n## Baseline\n#Employment, capital accumulation, and income\nplot(N[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), ylab = '', xlab = '')\ntitle(main=\"Figure 1: Employment, capital accumulation, and income\",ylab = 'N', xlab = 'Time', cex=0.8, line=2)\npar(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.3)\npar(new = TRUE)\nplot(K[1, Tmin:Tmax],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=2, font.main=1,cex.main=1,ylab = '', axes=FALSE,\n     xlab = '',ylim = range(Y[1, 2:(Tmax+1)]),cex.axis=1,cex.lab=0.75)\nlines(Y[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\naxis(side = 4, at = pretty(range(Y[1, 2:(Tmax+1)])))  \nmtext(\"K, Y\", side = 4, line = 2)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend=c(\"N\", \"K\", \"Y\"),\n       lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Real wage, subsistence wage, and MPL\nplot(w[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\", ylim=range(wS[1, Tmin:Tmax],w[1, Tmin:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 2: Real wage, marginal product of labour, and subsistence wage\", xlab = 'Time',cex=0.8,line=2)\nlines(MPL[1, Tmin:Tmax],lty=2)\nlines(wS[1, Tmin:Tmax],lty=3)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"w\", \"MPL\", \"wS\"),\n       lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Profits and Rents\nplot(P[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\", ylim=range(P[1, Tmin:Tmax])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 3: Profits and rents\", xlab = 'Time',cex=0.8,line=2)\npar(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.3)\npar(new = TRUE)\nplot(R[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=2, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"P\", \n     ylim=range(R[1, 3:Tmax]), axes=FALSE) \naxis(side = 4, at = pretty(range(R[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)])))  \nmtext(\"R\", side = 4, line = 2)\nlegend(\"right\", legend=c(\"P\", \"R\"), lty=1:2, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 displays capital accumulation under the different scenarios described in Table 1.

This yields the two-dimensional dynamic system in \\(K_t\\) and \\(w_t\\):\n\\[\nK_t = (1-\\beta)K_{t-1}+\\beta(aA N_{t-1}^a )\n\\] \\[\nN_t = N_{t-1} +\\gamma\\left(\\frac{K_{t-1}}{N_{t-1}} -w^S\\right)\n\\] The Jacobian matrix is given by: \\[\nJ(K, N)=\\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\beta& \\beta a^2AN^{\\alpha-1} \\\\\\frac{\\gamma}{N} & 1-\\frac{\\gamma K}{N^2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nFrom equations Equation 12.7 and Equation 12.8, it can readily be seen that an equilibrium is reached when \\[\nP^*=0\n\\] and \\[\nw^*=w^S.\n\\] Using \\(P^*=0\\) with Equation 12.5 and Equation 12.6, yields \\(w^*=w^S=MPL\\). Thus, in equilibrium, profits are zero, and the real wage is equal to the MPL and the subsistence wage. Setting \\(K_t=K_{t-1}\\) and \\(N_t=N_{t-1}\\), we can further derive:\n\\[\nK^*=aA\\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{-\\frac{a}{1-a}}\n\\] and\n\\[\nN^*=\\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{1-a}}\n\\] With this, we can evaluate the Jacobian at the steady state: \\[\nJ(K^*, N^*)=\\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\beta & \\beta a w^S \\\\ \\gamma \\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-a}} & 1-\\gamma aA \\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{\\frac{2-a}{1-a}}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] For the system to be stable, both eigenvalues of the Jacobian need to be inside the unit circle. This requires the following three conditions to hold:\n\\[\n1+tr(J)+det(J)&gt;0\n\\] \\[\n1+tr(J)-det(J)&gt;0\n\\] \\[\n1-det(J)&gt;0,\n\\] where \\(tr(J)\\) is the trace and \\(det(J)\\) is the determinant of the Jacobian.\nLet us consider the Classical case where \\(\\beta=1\\), i.e. all profits are reinvested. Then we have\n\\[\ndet(J)=-aw^S \\gamma \\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-a}}&lt;0,\n\\] so that the third condition is always satisfied and it is the first one that is binding. The first condition then becomes\n\\[\n2-\\gamma a \\left[ A \\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{\\frac{2-a}{1-a}} + w^S\\left(\\frac{w^S}{aA}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-a}} \\right]&gt;0\n\\]\nWe can check the analytical solutions and stability conditions numerically:\n\n# Calculate equilibrium solutions\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  N_eq[i]=(wS[i,T]/(a[i,T]*A[i,T]))^(-1/(1-a[i,T]))\n  K_eq[i]=a[i,T]*A[i,T]*(wS[i,T]/(a[i,T]*A[i,T]))^(-a[i,T]/(1-a[i,T]))\n}\n\n# Compare with numerical solutions (here only for baseline)\nN_eq[1]\n\n[1] 30.94046\n\nN[1,T]\n\n[1] 30.94031\n\nK_eq[1]\n\n[1] 15.47023\n\nK[1,T]\n\n[1] 15.47018\n\n### Examine model properties (here for the baseline scenario only)\n# Construct Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium \nJ=matrix(c(1-beta, beta*a[1,T]*wS[1,T],\n           beta*(wS[1,T]/(a[1,T]*A[1,T]))^(1/(1-a[1,T])),\n           1-gamma*a[1,T]*A[1,T]*(wS[1,T]/(a[1,T]*A[1,T]))^((2-a[1,T])/(1-a[1,T]))), 2, 2, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Obtain eigenvalues\nev=eigen(J)\n(values = ev$values)\n\n[1]  0.93134557 -0.01214592\n\n# Obtain determinant and trace\ndet=det(J)      # determinant\ntr=sum(diag(J)) # trace\n\n#Check general stability conditions\nprint(1+tr+det&gt;0)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nprint(1-tr+det&gt;0)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nprint(1-det&gt;0)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Check specific stability condition for the case beta=1\nfor (i in 1:S){\nprint(paste0(\"Scenario \", i, \":\"))\nprint(2-gamma*a[i,T]*(A[i,T]*(wS[i,T]/(a[i,T]*A[i,T]))^((2-a[i,T])/(1-a[i,T])) \n                      + wS[i,T]*(wS[i,T]/(a[i,T]*A[i,T]))^(1/(1-a[i,T])))&gt;0)\n}\n\n[1] \"Scenario 1:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 2:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 3:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 4:\"\n[1] TRUE"

The subscripts 1 and 2 denote the corn, i.e. agricultural, sector and the luxury goods sectors, respectively.\nEquation 13.1 is the production function with \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\), i.e. exhibiting diminishing marginal returns to labour.3 By Equation 13.4, the wage fund is defined as the capital stock of this model (reflecting the fact that the production of corn only involves labour). Equation 13.5 defines the real wage rate. Equation 13.5 specifies the marginal product of labour. By Equation 13.3, employment in agriculture is residually determined after employment in the luxury goods sector has been determined (more on this below) Equation 13.6 captures the determination of (differential) rents as a negative function of the marginal product of labour.4 Thus, the lower the productivity on the marginal land, the higher the rents. By Equation 13.7, profits in agriculture are determined residually. Equation Equation 13.8 specifies price determination and captures Ricardo’s labour theory of value according to which the value of a good (net of rent) is determined by the quantity of labour required to produce it. 5\nEquation 13.9 specifies that the production of the luxury good is demand determined. Only landlords consume luxuries and they spend all their income (rent) on luxuries.6 With production in sector 2 demand determined, employment in sector 2 as given by Equation 13.10 must accommodate based on the production function \\(Y_{2t}=a_2N_{2t}\\). With employment in sector 2 pinned down in this way and total employment given by the wage fund (Equation 13.4), employment in sector 1 must be the residual (as specified in equation Equation 13.3). From the labour theory of value, \\(p_2Y_2=N_2\\) must hold. Together with the production function \\(Y_{2t}=a_2N_{2t}\\) this yields Equation 13.11 for the price of the luxury good. Note that due to the constant marginal returns in this sector, its price is constant too.7 By Equation 13.12, profits in the luxuries sector are determined residually (note that no rent is paid by this sector).\nEquation 13.13 specifies total profits (in nominal terms).8 Capital accumulation in equation Equation 13.14 is driven by the reinvestment of profits (with \\(\\beta\\) determining the proportion of profits that are reinvested). Finally, Equation 13.15 specifies population dynamics, whereby the population increases whenever the actual real wage is above the subsistence wage, echoing the Malthusian population mechanism."

Starting from below-equilibrium levels, the economy grows in terms of output, capital, and employment but then approaches what Ricardo famously called a ‘stationary state’. Figure 3 shows that during the adjustment phase, the MPL declines, reflecting diminishing marginal returns in agriculture. This captures the idea that a growing economy will have to utilise less fertile lands. The real wage is driven up until it is equal to the MPL. Figure 4 shows that total profits initially increase but are then squeezed to zero as differential rents increase.\n\n# Set start and end periods for plots\nTmax=100\nTmin=6\n\n## Baseline\n#Employment and capital accumulation\nplot(N[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), ylab = '', xlab = '')\ntitle(main=\"Figure 1: Employment and capital accumulation\",ylab = 'N', xlab = 'Time', cex=0.8, line=2)\npar(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.3)\npar(new = TRUE)\nplot(K[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=2, font.main=1,cex.main=1,ylab = '', axes=FALSE,\n     xlab = '',ylim = range(K[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)]), cex=0.8)\naxis(side = 4, at = pretty(range(K[1, 2:(Tmax+1)])))  \nmtext(\"K\", side = 4, line = 2)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend=c(\"N\", \"K\"),\n       lty=1:2, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n#Output in the two sectors\nplot(Y1[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\", ylim=range(Y1[1, Tmin:Tmax],Y2[1, Tmin:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 2: Output in agriculture and luxuries\", xlab = 'Time',cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(Y2[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],lty=2)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend=c(\"Y1\", \"Y2\"),\n       lty=1:2, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Real wage, MPL, and subsistence wage\nplot(w[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\", ylim=range(wS[1, Tmin:Tmax],w[1, Tmin:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 3: Real wage, marginal product of labour, and subsistence wage\", xlab = 'Time',cex=0.8,line=2)\nlines(MPL[1, Tmin:Tmax],lty=2)\nlines(wS[1, Tmin:Tmax],lty=3)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"w\", \"MPL\", \"wS\"),\n       lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n# Total Profits and Rents\nplot(P[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlim=range(0:(Tmax)), xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\", ylim=range(P[1, Tmin:Tmax],R[1, Tmin:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Figure 4: Total profits and rents\", xlab = 'Time',cex=0.8,line=2)\nlines(R[1, Tmin:(Tmax+1)],lty=2)\nlegend(\"right\", legend=c(\"P\", \"R\"),\n       lty=1:2, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n\n\n\n\nFigures 5 and 6 display capital accumulation under the five different scenarios described in Table 1. Technical change that increases productivity in agriculture (scenarios 2 and 3) raises the speed of capital accumulation and the equilibrium level of capital. By contrast, an increase in productivity in the luxury good sector (scenario 4) has no effect on capital accumulation. This is because productivity in sector 2 has no effects on functional income distribution.9 An increase in the initial stock of capital (scenario 5) raises the steady state value.

The subsistence wage (\\(w^S\\)) is another exogenous variable that impacts the system through its effect on population dynamics. Productivity in the luxuries sector (\\(a_2\\)) feeds into the system via employment.ost other variables are endogenous and form a closed loop (or cycle) within the system. Profits are a residual. The directed graph illustrates the supply-driven nature of the agricultural sector, where (marginal) productivity determine employment and distribution. By contrast, the luxury goods sector is demand-determined with employment being the residual. Profits determine capital accumulation, which in turn provides funds that can be used to hire more agricultural workers. A higher subsistence wage reduces capital accumulation as it leaves fewer profits to be reinvested."

    "text": "Analytical discussion\nTo analyse the dynamics, combine Equation 13.1 to Equation 13.13 and substitute into Equation 13.14. Further use Equation 13.4 and Equation 13.5 in Equation 13.15. This yields the two-dimensional dynamic system in \\(K_t\\) and \\(w_t\\):\n\\[\nK_t = (1-\\beta)K_{t-1}+\\beta(a_1^{a_1}A N_{t-1}^{a_1} )\n\\] \\[\nN_t = N\\_{t-1} +\\gamma\\left(\\frac{K_{t-1}}{N_{t-1}} -w^S\\right)\n\\] The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\\[\nJ(K, N)=\\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\beta& \\beta a_1^{1+a_1}AN^{a_1-1} \\\\\\frac{\\gamma}{N} & 1-\\frac{\\gamma K}{N^2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nFrom equations Equation 13.14 and Equation 13.15, it can readily be seen that an equilibrium is reached when \\[\nP^*=0\n\\] and \\[\nw^*=w^S.\n\\] Using \\(P^*=0\\) with Equation 13.6 and Equation 13.13, yields \\(w^*=w^S=MPL\\). Thus, in equilibrium, profits are zero, and the real wage is equal to the MPL and the subsistence wage. Setting \\(K_t=K_{t-1}\\) and \\(N_t=N_{t-1}\\), we can further derive:\n\\[\nK^*=a_1^{a_1}A\\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{-\\frac{a_1}{1-a_1}}\n\\] and\n\\[\nN^*=\\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{1-a_1}}\n\\] With this, we can evaluate the Jacobian at the steady state: \\[\nJ(K^*, N^*)=\\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\beta & \\beta a_1 w^S \\\\ \\gamma \\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-a_1}} & 1-\\gamma a_1^{a_1}A \\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{\\frac{2-a_1}{1-a_1}}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] For the system to be stable, both eigenvalues of the Jacobian need to be inside the unit circle. This requires the following three conditions to hold:\n\\[\n1+tr(J)+det(J)&gt;0\n\\] \\[\n1+tr(J)-det(J)&gt;0\n\\] \\[\n1-det(J)&gt;0,\n\\] where \\(tr(J)\\) is the trace and \\(det(J)\\) is the determinant of the Jacobian.\nLet us consider the Classical case where \\(\\beta=1\\), i.e. all profits are reinvested. Then we have\n\\[\ndet(J)=-a_1w^S \\gamma \\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-a_1}}&lt;0,\n\\]\nso that the third condition is always satisfied and it is the first one that is binding. The first condition then becomes\n\\[\n2-\\gamma  \\left[a_1^{a_1} A \\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{\\frac{2-a_1}{1-a_1}} + a_1 w^S\\left(\\frac{w^S}{a_1^{a_1}A}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-a_1}} \\right]&gt;0\n\\]\nWe can check the analytical solutions and stability conditions numerically:\n\n# Calculate equilibrium solutions\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  N_eq[i]=(wS[i,T]/((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[i,T]))^(-1/(1-a1[i,T]))\n  K_eq[i]=(a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[i,T]*(wS[i,T]/((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[i,T]))^(-a1[i,T]/(1-a1[i,T]))\n}\n\n# Compare with numerical solutions (here for the example of Y, baseline)\nN_eq[1]\n\n[1] 44.20066\n\nN[1,T]\n\n[1] 44.19942\n\nK_eq[1]\n\n[1] 22.10033\n\nK[1,T]\n\n[1] 22.09989\n\n### Examine model properties (here for the baseline scenario only)\n# Construct Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium \nJ=matrix(c(1-beta, \n           beta*a1[1,T]*wS[1,T],\n           gamma*(wS[1,T]/((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[1,T]))^(1/(1-a1[1,T])),\n           1-gamma*(a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[1,T]*(wS[1,T]/((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[1,T]))^((2-a1[1,T])/(1-a1[1,T]))), 2, 2, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Obtain eigenvalues\nev=eigen(J)\n(values = ev$values)\n\n[1]  0.98368845 -0.04024869\n\n# Obtain determinant and trace\ndet=det(J)      # determinant\ntr=sum(diag(J)) # trace\n\n#Check stability conditions\nprint(1+tr+det&gt;0)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nprint(1-tr+det&gt;0)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nprint(1-det&gt;0)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Check specific stability condition for the case beta=1\nfor (i in 1:S){\nprint(paste0(\"Scenario \", i, \":\"))\nprint(2-gamma*((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[i,T]*(wS[i,T]/(((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[i,T])))^((2-a1[i,T])/(1-a1[i,T]))) + a1[i,T]*wS[i,T]*(wS[i,T]/(((a1[i,T]^a1[i,T])*A[i,T]))^(1/(1-a1[i,T])))&gt;0)\n}\n\n[1] \"Scenario 1:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 2:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 3:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 4:\"\n[1] TRUE\n[1] \"Scenario 5:\"\n[1] TRUE"

Note that by using Equation 13.2, Equation 13.6 can also be written as \\(R_t = Y_{1t}(1-a_1)\\).↩︎\nTo see this, notice that equation Equation 13.8 can be derived from \\(p_{t1}Y_{t1}-p_{t1}R_{t}=N_{t1}\\) if combined with equation Equation 13.6.↩︎\nOutput in equation Equation 13.9 is expressed in real terms and can be derived from \\(p_{2}Y_{2t}=p_{1t}R_t\\).↩︎\nThe luxury good may therefore serve as Ricardo’s ‘invariable standard of value’ in terms of which the value of all commodities could be expressed.↩︎\nNote that by combining Equation 13.13 with Equation 13.9, total profits can also be written as \\(P_t=p_{1t}(Y_{1t} - W_t)\\).
