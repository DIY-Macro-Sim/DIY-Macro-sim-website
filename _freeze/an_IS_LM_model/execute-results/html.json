Hicks (1937) to formalise some key ideas of John Maynard Keynes' 1936 book [The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money). The model contains two equilibrium relationships: a goods market equilibrium between investment and saving (IS) and a money market equilibrium between money demand and money supply (LM). In the goods market, aggregate supply adjusts to the level of aggregate demand given by the expenditure decisions of households, firms, and the government. Households form their consumption demand based on a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income. Firms take investment decisions based on the rate of interest. Money demand is determined by aggregate income (transactions demand) and the interest rate on bonds (speculative demand). The money supply is assumed to be exogenous and under the control of the central bank. The two markets pin down equilibrium output and the interest rate. The goods market equilibrium may well coincide with involuntary unemployment. Adverse shocks to autonomous investment ('animal spirits') or autonomous money demand ('liquidity preference') reduce output and raise unemployment. The government can use monetary policy, fiscal spending, and income taxes to stimulate economic activity and achieve full employment.\n\nIn this short-run model, prices and the capital stock are fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. As all endogenous variables adjust instantaneously, the model is static. We consider a version with linear functions, adapted from Blanchard and Johnson [-@Blanchard2013, chap.5].\n\n## The Model \n\n$$\nY=C+I+G\n$$ {#eq-islmY}\n\n$$\nC=c_{0}+c_{1}(Y-T), \\quad c_{1} \\in(0,1)\n$$ {#eq-islmC}\n\n$$\nI=i_{0}-i_{1} r, \\quad i_{1}>0\n$$ {#eq-islmI}\n\n$$\nG=G_{0}\n$$ {#eq-islmG}\n\n$$\nT=T_{0}\n$$ {#eq-islmT}\n\n$$\nM_{s}=M_{0}\n$$ {#eq-islmMs}\n\n$$\nM_{d}=m_{0}+m_{1} Y-m_{2} r, \\quad m_{1}>0\n$$ {#eq-islmMd}\n\n$$\nM=M_{d}=M_{s}\n$$ {#eq-islmM}\n\n$$\nN=a Y, \\quad a>0\n$$ {#eq-islmN}\n\n$$\nU=1-\\frac{N}{N^{f}}\n$$ {#eq-islmU}\n\nwhere $Y$, $C$, $I$, $G$, $T$, $r$, $M_{d}$, $M_{s}$, $N$, $U$ and $N^{f}$ are output, consumption, investment, government spending, taxes, the interest rate on bonds, money demand, money supply, employment, the unemployment rate, and the labour force, respectively. The constant price level has been normalised to unity.\n\n@eq-islmY is the goods market equilibrium condition. Aggregate supply $(Y)$ accommodates to the level of aggregate demand which is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending. @eq-islmC is the consumption function consisting of autonomous consumption demand $\\left(c_{0}\\right)$ and a marginal propensity to consume $\\left(c_{1}\\right)$ out of disposable income $(Y-T)$. Investment demand in @eq-islmI has an autonomous component $\\left(i_{0}\\right)$ capturing Keynesian animal spirits and a component that is negatively related to the rate of interest on bonds. By equations @eq-islmG and @eq-islmT, government spending and taxation are exogenous. Similarly, the money supply in @eq-islmMs is assumed to be exogenous. By @eq-islmMd, households' money demand is positively related to income (capturing the transaction demand for money) and negatively related to the interest rate on bonds (capturing speculative demand). There is also an autonomous term $\\left(m_{0}\\right)$ capturing Keynesian liquidity preference. @eq-islmN is a fixed-coefficient production function through which employment is determined. In conjunction with an exogenously given labour force $\\left(N^{f}\\right)$, the level of employment can be used to obtain an unemployment rate in @eq-islmU.\n\n## Simulation\n\n### Parameterisation \n\nTable 1 reports the parameterisation used in the simulation. Besides a baseline (labelled as scenario 1), five further scenarios will be considered. Scenarios 2 and 3 model a switch towards pessimistic sentiments: a fall in animal spirits $\\left(i_{0}\\right)$ and an increase in liquidity preference $\\left(m_{0}\\right)$. Scenarios 4 to 6 consider three different government policies to stimulate the economy: a monetary expansion $\\left(M_{0}\\right)$, a tax cut $\\left(T_{0}\\right)$, and a fiscal expansion $\\left(G_{0}\\right)$.\n\n**Table 1: Parameterisation**\n\n| Scenario | $c_{0}$ | $c_{1}$ | $i_{0}$ | $i_{1}$ | $m_{0}$ | $m_{1}$ | $m_{2}$ | $M_{0}$ | $T_{0}$ | $G_{0}$ | $a$ | $N^{f}$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1: baseline | 2 | 0.6 | 2 | 0.1 | 6 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1.5 | 18 |\n| 2: fall in animal spirits ($i_{0}$) | 2 | 0.6 | 1 | 0.1 | 6 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1.5 | 18 |\n| 3: increased liquidity preference ($m_{0}$) | 2 | 0.6 | 2 | 0.1 | 7 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1.5 | 18 |\n| 4: monetary expansion ($M_{0}$) | 2 | 0.6 | 2 | 0.1 | 6 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 6 | 1 | 1 | 1.5 | 18 |\n| 5: tax cut ($T_{0}$) | 2 | 0.6 | 2 | 0.1 | 6 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 1.5 | 18 |\n| 6: fiscal expansion ($G_{0}$) | 2 | 0.6 | 2 | 0.1 | 6 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 1.5 | 18 |\n\n\n### Simulation code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Clear the environment\nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of scenarios (including baseline)\nS=6\n\n#Create vector in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nY_star=vector(length=S) # Income/output\nC_star=vector(length=S) # Consumption\nI_star=vector(length=S) # Investment\nr_star=vector(length=S) # Real interest rate\nN_star=vector(length=S) # Employment\nU_star=vector(length=S) # Unemployment rate\n\n# Set exogenous variables that will be shifted\ni0=vector(length=S) # autonomous investment\nm0=vector(length=S) # Autonomous demand for money\nM0=vector(length=S) # money supply\nG0=vector(length=S) # government spending\nT0=vector(length=S) # taxes\ni0[]=2\nm0[]=6\nM0[]=5   \nG0[]=1   \nT0[]=1\n\n## Construct scenarios\n# scenario 2: fall in animal spirits\ni0[2]=1\n \n#scenario 3: increase in liquidity preference\nm0[3]=7\n\n# scenario 4: monetary expansion \nM0[4]=6\n\n# scenario 5: reduction in tax rate\nT0[5]=0  \n\n# scenario 6: fiscal expansion\nG0[6]=2 \n\n#Set constant parameter values\nc0=2   # Autonomous consumption\nc1=0.6 # Sensitivity of consumption with respect to the income (marginal propensity to consume)\ni1=0.1 # Sensitivity of investment with respect to the interest rate\nm1=0.2 # Sensitivity of money demand with respect to income\nm2=0.4 # Sensitivity of money demand with respect to interest rate\na=1.5  # labour coefficient\nNf=18  # Full employment/labour force\n\n# Initialise endogenous variables at some arbitrary positive value \nY = C = I =r = N = U = 1\n\n#Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialisation\n\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  \n  for (iterations in 1:1000){\n    \n    #Model equations\n    \n    # Goods market equilibrium\n    Y = C + I + G0[i]\n    \n    # Consumption demand\n    C = c0 + c1*(Y-T0[i])\n    \n    # Investment demand\n    I = i0[i] -

A fall in animal spirits (scenario 2) and an increase in liquidity preference (scenario 3) both have contractionary effects. While the fall in animal spirits directly reduces aggregate demand and thereby output (despite a fall in the interest rate), the rise in liquidity preference depresses output through its positive effect on the interest rate. Both scenarios raise the unemployment rate (@fig-U). Scenarios 4 to 6 assess three different macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate output. It can be seen in @fig-output that fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy for the parameterisation in Table 1.^[The analytical discussion below shows formally that fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy if $m_{2}>i_{2}$.] Direct fiscal stimulus is more effective than tax cuts due to the constant marginal propensity to consume. The effect on output is a multiple of the one-unit stimulus thanks to the multiplier effect. However, it can also be seen that fiscal policy raises the interest rate, which crowds out some of the expansionary effect.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(Y_star, ylab=\"Y\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"), cex.names = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Output](an_IS_LM_model_files/figure-html/fig-output-1.png){#fig-output width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(r_star, ylab=\"r\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"), cex.names = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Interest rate](an_IS_LM_model_files/figure-html/fig-r-1.png){#fig-r width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(U_star*100, ylab=\"U (%)\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                              \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"), cex.names = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Unemployment](an_IS_LM_model_files/figure-html/fig-U-1.png){#fig-U width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-I and @fig-C further show that monetary policy mostly stimulates investment, whereas fiscal policy boost consumption.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(I_star, ylab=\"I\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"), cex.names = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Investment](an_IS_LM_model_files/figure-html/fig-I-1.png){#fig-I width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(C_star, ylab=\"C\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                                      \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"), cex.names = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Consumption](an_IS_LM_model_files/figure-html/fig-C-1.png){#fig-C width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(N_star, ylab=\"N\", names.arg=c(\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\", \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"), cex.names = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Employment](an_IS_LM_model_files/figure-html/fig-N-1.png){#fig-N width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Plot results (here only for output)    \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nscenario_names = [\"1:Baseline\", \"2:Fall animal spirits\", \"3:Rise liq. pref.\",\n                  \"4:Monetary exp.\", \"5:Tax cut\", \"6:Fiscal exp.\"]\n\nplt.bar(scenario_names, Y_star)\nplt.ylabel('Y')\nplt.xticks( scenario_names, rotation=45, fontsize=6)\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: \n\n## Directed graph\n\nAnother perspective on the model's properties is provided by its directed graph.
