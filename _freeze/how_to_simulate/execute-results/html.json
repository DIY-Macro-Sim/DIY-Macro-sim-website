It finishes with a little exercise that will help you build the skills to simulate and visualise models yourself.\n\n## Introduction: economic models\n\nWhy do we build formal economic models? Because they help us think carefully about the *causal mechanisms* that generate certain economic outcomes (e.g. unemployment). Models are especially useful when the variables of interest are inherently quantitative (e.g. the interest rate and unemployment) and when several of these quantitative variables interact with each other. More specifically, models provide a precise formal representation of a set of *interlinked* causal mechanisms that are often difficult to analyse informally.\n\nEvery economic model essentially consist of three things:\n\n1.  a set of $N$ equations\n\n2.  a set of $N$ endogenous variables\n\n3.  a set of exogenous or fixed coefficients ('parameters') and exogenous variables\n\nThe solution to the model, its 'equilibrium', will pin down values for the endogenous variables of the model for a given set of parameters and exogenous variables. Thus, the endogenous variables, e.g. unemployment, are determined within the system, while exogenous variables are determined outside of the system and often reflect policy variables, such as the central bank interest rate. The equations connect the variables of the system. They typically express:\n\n-   economic (accounting) identities (e.g. that in a closed economy without government, saving is income that is not consumed: $S=Y-C$)\n\n-   budget constraints (e.g. that business investment can be financed out of retained profits and new debt, $I=\\Pi+\\Delta D$)\n\n-   behavioural functions (e.g. that households consume a constant proportion of their income, $C=c_1Y$), which often contain key parameters of the model (e.g. the marginal propensity to consume $c_1$)\n\n-   equilibrium conditions (e.g. that demand must be equal to supply)\n\nEquations may be linear or nonlinear. If a model contains nonlinear relationships between the endogenous variables, it may admit more than one solution (often called multiple equilibria).\n\nEconomic models can be either static or dynamic. In a static model, time plays no role and all endogenous variables are determined simultaneously. In a dynamic model, time matters and the endogenous variables adjust gradually over time.\n\nThe endogenous variables are typically interrelated: e.g. $x$ determines $y$, but $y$ also determines $x$. These interrelationships can be:\n\n-   simultaneous: $x$ and $y$ determine each other simultaneously (within the same period)\n\n-   recursive: $x$ affects $y$ only in $t+1$ (or vice versa)\n\nUnlike static models, dynamic models describe what happens out of equilibrium.^[That raises the question of whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable, which is discussed in @sec-stab_analysis.] Note that dynamic models may contain both simultaneous and recursive relationships.\n\nWhether the relationships between the variables is simultaneous or recursive has implications for how the model can be solved. In general, simple economic models can often be solved analytically without a computer. If the model contains simultaneous relationships, it needs to be solved as a simultaneous system by solving for the endogenous variables through repeated substitution. This means going from the so-called 'structural form', i.e. the full set of equations, to the so-called 'reduced form', where the right-hand side of the equations only contains exogenous variables and parameters. If the system is linear, techniques from linear algebra such as matrix inversion or Cramer's rule can be used (see @Chiang2005, chaps. 4-5). If the system contains recursive relationships, the equilibrium solution can be found by setting $x_{t+i}=x_{t-i}=x_{t}$ for all $x$ and then solving the resulting simultaneous system (more on this @sec-stab_analysis).\n\nHowever, often a complete analytical solution is difficult to come by. Common challenges are:\n\n-   a model has more than 3 dimensions ($N>3$): then it's very tedious to compute analytical solutions\n\n-   a model has nonlinearities that preclude the computation of analytical solutions\n\n-   a model is dynamic and you want to examine the dynamic adjustment of the endogenous variables (which is tedious to do analytically)\n\nIn these cases, numerical solution by means of computer simulation becomes useful. A key advantage is that it allows you to study much more complex models than the analytical approach does. A key disadvantage is that numerical solution requires the choice of a (possibly arbitrary) set of numerical values for the models' parameters. It is thus less general than analytical solution -- a limitation which should be borne in mind. We think that both analytical and numerical approaches are useful. Correspondingly, we supplement the numerical simulations with analytical model solutions where possible.\n\n## Solving economic models numerically\n\nIf a (dynamic) model exclusively contains recursive relationships, it can be solved iteratively by sequentially updating the endogenous variables from (arbitrarily set) initial conditions. This is easy to do with a computer. By contrast, if interrelationships are simultaneous, solving the system for the endogenous variables as described above is less trivial for a computer (finding the solution for $x$ requires the solution of $y$, but the latter requires in turn the solution for $x$). One approach is to use linear algebra: cast the system in matrix form ($b=Ax$) and let the computer find $x^*=A^{-1}b$ through some algorithm (e.g. [the Gauss-Seidel method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method)).\n\nWe will use an approach that is simpler and based on *iteration*:\n\n-   choose a set of numerical parameter values (e.g. $c_1=0.8$)\n\n-   choose (arbitrary but non-zero) initial values for the endogenous variables (e.g. $C_0=1)$\n\n-   then solve the system of equations many times using a *for loop*\n\nIn this way, the solution gets approximated successively.\n\nA limitation of the method of iteration is that it will only converge to the solution of the simultaneous component of a model if the equilibrium is stable (more on stability in @sec-stab_analysis). For most static models, stability is required for the model to be economically meaningful. In that sense, if the iterative approach does not yield a solution, this is a sign that the model and/or parameterisation needs to be reconsidered. In dynamic models, stability is a key question that should be addressed in any case. Therefore, this limitation of the method of iteration may not be too restrictive in practice.\n\n### Solving economic models numerically: examples\n\n#### A static model {#sec-static-Keynesian-model}\n\nConsider a two-dimensional simultaneous system represented by a simple Keynesian goods market model:\n\n$$\nY= C + I_0\n$$ $$\nC = c_0 + c_1Y\n$$ In a closed economy without government, aggregate demand is composed of consumption $C$ and investment $I$, with the latter assumed to be exogenous. Goods market equilibrium requires aggregate demand to be equal to aggregate income $Y$. Consumption is assumed to be determined by an autonomous component $c_0$ and a marginal propensity to consume out of income $c_1$.\n\nSuppose the parameters are given by $c_0=3$ and $c_1=0.8$. You are interested in how a change in investment from $I_0=5$ to $I_0=6$ affects the solution of the system. Through the method of substitution, we can easily derive that $Y^*=\\frac{c_0+I_0}{1-c_1}$. The code below shows how to find this solution via simulation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Simulate Keynesian goods market model via iteration\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=2\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0=3\nc1=0.8\n\n#Create vector in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nY_eq=vector(length=S)\nC_eq=vector(length=S)\n\n#Create vector with parameter that will change \nI0=vector(length=S)\nI0[1]=5\nI0[2]=6\n\n# Initialise endogenous variables at arbitrary positive value \nY=C=1\n\n#Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialisation\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  for (iteration in 1:1000){\n  Y = C + I0[i]\n  C = c0 + c1*Y\n  } # close iterations loop\n  \n#Save results for different parameterisations in vector\nY_eq[i]=Y\nC_eq[i]=C\n} # close parameterisations loop\n\n# Display solutions\nY_eq\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 40 45\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nC_eq\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 35 39\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0[])/(1-c1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 40 45\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n### Simulate Keynesian goods market model via iteration\n\n# Load NumPy library\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set the number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS = 2\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0 = 3\nc1 = 0.8\n\n# Create numpy arrays in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nY_eq = np.zeros(S)\nC_eq = np.zeros(S)\n\n# Create a numpy array with the parameter that will change\nI0 = np.zeros(S)\nI0[0] = 5\nI0[1] = 6\n\n# Initialize endogenous variables at an arbitrary positive value\nY = C = 1\n\n# Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialization\nfor i in range(S):\n    for iteration in range(1000):\n        Y = C + I0[i]\n        C = c0 + c1 * Y\n\n    # Save results for different parameterisations in the numpy arrays\n    Y_eq[i] = Y\n    C_eq[i] = C\n\n# Display solutions\nY_eq\nC_eq\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0)/(1-c1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nLet's break this code down a little bit:\n\n-   set the number of scenarios $S$, define parameter values, and create vectors of length $S$ in which the results for the endogenous variables will be stored\n\n-   define changes in exogenous variables or parameters (i.e. construct different scenarios)\n\n-   initialise the endogenous variables\n\n-   write down the equations (solved for the endogenous variables such that every endogenous variable of the system appears on the left-hand side of an equation exactly once)\n\n-   place these equations inside a *for loop*\n\n    -   the loop says: repeat the segment of code insights the curly brackets 1000 times\n\n-   nest the loop that solves the system in an outer loop that loops through different parameterisations (here for $I_0$)\n\n-   after the iterations loop is finished, save the results for the current pameterisation\n\nWhat happens is the following: in the first iteration, $Y$ and $C$ are calculated based on the initial values and the parameter values. In the second iteration, the values are then overwritten based on the results from the first iteration. This process continues 1000 times. In this way, the correct solution is successively approximated. If you have an analytical solution, you can compare it with the numerical one to double-check your results.\n\nWhen does the method of iteration fail to provide a solution? In the following code, everything is the same with the only difference that the marginal propensity to consume is now larger than unity ($c_1=1.2$). Now the numerical simulation fails to find the solution. This is because with $c_1>0$, the so-called Keynesian equilibrium condition is violated and the system happens to be unstable. We will discuss in @sec-stab_analysis the issue of stability and how to analyse it formally. At this point, we simply note that the method of iterations requires static models to be stable to yield equilibrium solutions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Parameterisation for which method of iteration fails\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=2\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0=3\nc1=1.2\n\n#Create vector in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nY_eq=vector(length=S)\nC_eq=vector(length=S)\n\n#Create vector with parameter that will change \nI0=vector(length=S)\nI0[1]=5\nI0[2]=6\n\n# Initialise endogenous variables at arbitrary positive value \nY=C=1\n\n#Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialisation\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  for (iteration in 1:1000){\n  Y = C + I0[i]\n  C = c0 + c1*Y\n  } # close iterations loop\n  \n#Save results for different parameterisations in vector\nY_eq[i]=Y\nC_eq[i]=C\n} # close parameterisations loop\n\n# Display solutions\nY_eq\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  5.818655e+80 8.832196e+159\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0[])/(1-c1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -40 -45\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n### Parameterisation for which method of iteration fails\nc1 = 1.2  \n\n# Initialize endogenous variables at an arbitrary positive value\nY = C = 1\n\n# Solve this system numerically through 1000 iterations based on the initialization\nfor i in range(S):\n    for iteration in range(1000):\n        Y = C + I0[i]\n        C = c0 + c1 * Y\n\n    # Save results for different parameterisations in the numpy arrays\n    Y_eq[i] = Y\n    C_eq[i] = C\n\n# Display solutions for Y_eq\nY_eq\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0)/(1-c1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n#### A dynamic model (in discrete time)\n\nConsider now a dynamic version of the Keynesian goods market model that was proposed by Paul @Samuelson1939. In this model, investment ($I$) becomes endogenous and reacts to the change in consumption. Aggregate demand now also contains government spending ($G$), which is assumed to be exogenous. Consumption ($C$) responds to changes in income ($Y$) with a lag:\n\n$$\nY_t = C_t + I_t + G_0\n$$ $$\nI_t = \\beta(C_t - C_{t-1})\n$$ $$\nC_t=c_1Y_{t-1}.\n$$ This is a dynamic model, in which the endogenous variables adjust gradually over time. However, the model is not purely recursive as investment reacts to consumption in the same period (and output to consumption and investment). By shifting $Y_t=C_t + I_t + G_0$ one period back, substitution into the consumption, and then investment function, the system can be reduced to two equations that are fully recursive:\n\n$$\nC_t= c_1(C_{t-1} + I_{t-1} + G_0)\n$$ $$\nI_t= \\beta[c_1(C_{t-1} + I_{t-1} + G_0) - C_{t-1}]\n$$ We can find the solution for output analytically by setting $x_t=x_{t-1}$ for all variables and then applying the method of substitution. This yields $Y^*=\\frac{G_0}{1-c_1}$. The code below shows how to find this solution through simulation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Simulate Samuelson 1939\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of periods for which you want to simulate\nQ=100\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=2\n\n# Set period in which shock or shift in an will occur\ns=15\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc1=0.8\nbeta=0.6\n\n# Construct (S x Q) matrices in which values for different periods will be stored; initialise at 1\nC=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=Q)\nI=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=Q)\n\n#Construct matrices for exogenous variable or parameter that will change over time to capture different scenarios\nG0=matrix(data=5, nrow=S, ncol=Q)\n\n# Set parameter values for different scenarios\nG0[2,s:Q]=6     # scenario: permanent increase in government spending from I0=5 to I0=6 from period s=15 onwards\n\n#Solve this system recursively based on the initialisation\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  for (t in 2:Q){\n    C[i,t] = c1*(C[i,t-1] + I[i,t-1] + G0[i,t])\n    I[i,t] = beta*(c1*(C[i,t-1] + I[i,t-1] + G0[i,t]) - C[i,t-1])\n  } # close time loop\n}   # close scenarios loop\n\n# Calculate output\nY=C+G0+I\n\n# Display solution\nY[,Q]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 25 30\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(G0[,Q])/(1-c1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 25 30\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n### Simulate Samuelson 1939\n\n# Set the number of periods for which you want to simulate\nQ = 100\n\n# Set the number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS = 2\n\n# Set the period in which a shock or shift in 'an' will occur\ns = 15\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc1 = 0.8\nbeta = 0.6\n\n# Construct (S x Q) matrices in which values for different periods will be stored; initialize at 1\nC = np.ones((S, Q))\nI = np.ones((S, Q))\n\n# Construct matrices for exogenous variables or parameters that will change \n# over time to capture different scenarios, initialise at 5\nG0 = np.ones((S, Q))*5 \n\n# Set parameter values for different scenarios\nG0[1, s:Q] = 6  # scenario: permanent increase in government spending from I0=5 to I0=6 from period s=15 onwards\n\n# Solve this system recursively based on the initialization\nfor i in range(S):\n    for t in range(1, Q):\n        C[i, t] = c1 * (C[i, t - 1] + I[i, t - 1] + G0[i, t])\n        I[i, t] = beta * (c1 * (C[i, t - 1] + I[i, t - 1] + G0[i, t]) - \n                          C[i, t - 1])\n\n# Calculate output\nY = C + G0 + I\n\n# Display the solutions at time Q\nY[:, Q - 1]\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(G0[:,Q - 1])/(1-c1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nThe code solves the recursive system numerically through iteration. Let's again break down what the code does:\n\n-   set the number of periods for which we want to simulate the model (here $Q=100$), set the number of scenarios $S$ and the period $s$ in which a change in the scenario should occur\n\n-   set the parameter values and create $(S \\times Q)$ matrices in which the results for the endogenous variables will be stored, such that the columns represent time and the rows represent different scenarios; initialise the endogenous variables\n\n-   define changes in exogenous variables or parameters (i.e. construct different scenarios)\n\n-   write down the equations (solved for the endogenous variables such that every endogenous variable of the system appears on the left-hand side of an equation exactly once)\n\n-   place these equations inside a *for loop* that runs from $t=2$ to $Q$\n\n    -   the loop says: repeat the segment of code insights the curly brackets, each time with the index number $t$ shifted by $+1$ until $t=Q$\n\n-   nest the loop that solves the system in an outer loop that loops through different parameterisations (here for $G_0$)\n\nNote that due to the exclusive presence of recursive equations, no loop is need that iterates the equations within every period. However, many dynamic models contain both simultaneous and recursive equations. In this case, a third loop inside the time loop is needed that iterates the equations within each period so as to solve the simultaneous equations. Otherwise, the approach to solving dynamic systems is not fundamentally different from the one for static systems.\n\nAt the end of the simulation run, we can again compare the results from the numerical simulation with the analytical solution. However, what is perhaps more interesting is to trace the dynamic adjustment of the endogenous variables towards equilibrium. The best way to examine this is by plotting the results.\n\n## How to plot the results of a model\n\nWe will consider two main ways to plot model outputs: bar charts for static models and time series charts for dynamic models. Bar charts compare the equilibrium values of $Y_t$ for different parameterisations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Bar chart of different equilibrium solutions of Samuelson (1939) model\nbarplot(Y[,Q], ylab=\"Y\", main=\"Output\", names.arg=c(\"Baseline\", \"Increase in G0\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](how_to_simulate_files/figure-html/howto_4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we show a basic version of a time series chart that displays the dynamics of $Y_t$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Time series chart of output dynamics in Samuelson (1939) model\nplot(Y[1, 1:100],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"Time\", ylab=\"Y\") \ntitle(main=\"Output\", cex=0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](how_to_simulate_files/figure-html/howto_5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, there are many settings you can fiddle around with to adjust the appearance of the graph to your liking (run '?plot' to find information about the different options.)

A directed graph consists of a set of nodes that represent the variables of the model. Nodes are connected by directed edges. An edge directed from a node $x_1$ to node $x_2$ indicates a causal impact of $x_1$ on $x_2$.\n\nThe directed graph can be derived from the model's Jacobian matrix.[^how_to_simulate-1] Let $x$ be the vector containing the model's endogenous variables and $f(x)$ the system of equations making up the model. The Jacobian matrix is then given by $J=\\frac{\\partial f()}{\\partial x}$. As we often also want to display exogenous variables in the directed graph, it can be useful to expand the Jacobian matrix by adding rows and columns for those exogenous variables.\n\n[^how_to_simulate-1]: See @Fennell2015 for a neat exposition.\n\nNext, construct an 'auxiliary' Jacobian matrix $M$ in which all the non-zero elements of the Jacobian are replaced by ones, whereas zero elements remain unchanged, i.e.\n\n$$\nM_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if }  J_{ij} \\neq 0, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFinally, taking the transpose of this \\`auxiliary' Jacobian matrix yields the *adjacency matrix* $A=M^T$, which is a binary matrix whose elements ($A_{ji}$) indicate whether there is a directed edge from a node $x_j$ to node $x_i$. From the adjacency matrix, the directed graph is constructed. \n\nThe code below shows this for the example of the @Samuelson1939 model.^[To create the directed graph, we rely on external libraries which you may have to install first. In *R*, this can be accomplished with `install.packages(\"igraph\")` and in Python with `pip install networkx`. Once that library is installed, you only need to activate it in each session before you use it. In \n*R*, you can do this by executing `library(igraph)` and in *Python* through `import networkx`.]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Create directed graph\n# Construct auxiliary Jacobian matrix for 4 variables: \n  # endogenous: (1) Y, (2) C, (3) I\n  # exogenous: (4) G0\n# where non-zero elements in regular Jacobian are set to 1 and zero elements are unchanged\n\n            #  Y  C  I G0\nM_mat=matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 1, # Y\n               1, 0, 0, 0, # C\n               0, 1, 0, 0, # I\n               0, 0, 0, 0),# G0 \n               4, 4, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Create adjacency matrix from transpose of auxiliary Jacobian and add column names\nA_mat=t(M_mat)\n\n# Create directed graph from adjacency matrix\nlibrary(igraph)\ndg=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A_mat, mode=\"directed\", weighted= NULL)\n\n# Define node labels\nV(dg)$name=c(\"Y\", \"C\", \"I\", expression(G[0]))\n\n# Plot directed graph matrix\nplot(dg, main=\"Directed graph of Samuelson model\", vertex.size=20, vertex.color=\"lightblue\", \n     vertex.label.color=\"black\", edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.width=1.1, edge.size=1.2,\n     edge.arrow.width=1.2, edge.color=\"black\", vertex.label.cex=1.2, \n     vertex.frame.color=\"NA\", margin=-0.08)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](how_to_simulate_files/figure-html/how_to8-5.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n#Load relevant libraries\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Construct auxiliary Jacobian matrix for 4 variables\n  # endogenous: (1) Y, (2) C, (3) I\n  # exogenous: (4) G0\n# where non-zero elements in regular Jacobian are set to 1 and zero elements are\n# unchanged\nM_mat = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 1, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\n# Create adjacency matrix from transpose of auxiliary Jacobian and add column names\nA_mat = M_mat.transpose()\n\n# Create the graph from the adjacency matrix\nG = nx.DiGraph(A_mat)\n\n# Define node labels\nnodelabs = {0: \"Y\", 1: \"C\", 2: \"I\", 3: \"$G_0$\"}\n\n# Plot the directed graph\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  \nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, labels=nodelabs, node_size=500, node_color='lightblue', font_size=10)\nedge_labels = {(u, v): '' for u, v in G.edges}\nnx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels, font_color='black')\nplt.title(\"Directed graph of Samuelson model\", fontsize=12)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nBroadly speaking, three types of nodes are possible:\n\n1.  nodes from which arrows only point away represent *exogenous* variables ($G_0$)\n2. nodes towards which some arrows point, but from which arrows also point away, represent *endogenous* variables that also have a causal impact on other variables ($Y$, $C$, and $I$)\n3. nodes arrows only point towards represent endogenous variables that are *residuals* \n\nIt can thus be seen that the key exogenous variable in the @Samuelson1939 model is government spending $G_0$, which determines aggregate income, which in turn feeds into consumption.

Consider, for example, a continuous-time version of the Keynesian goods market model:\n\n$$\n\\dot{Y}= k(C + I_0 - Y)\n$$\n\n$$\nC = c_0 + c_1Y,\n$$ where $\\dot{Y}=\\frac{dY}{dt}$. To simulate this model, we have to approximate the differential equation for $\\dot{Y}$ by a difference equation for $Y_t$ and let the time increment $\\Delta t$ become very small. More specifically, we write:\n\n$$\nY(t+\\Delta t)=Y_t + \\dot{Y} \\Delta t =Y_t + [k(C + I_0 - Y)]\\Delta t.\n$$ This approach is also called the *Euler forward method*. The code below shows to implement that method. We use $\\Delta t = 0.01$. Note that we need to raise the time horizon $Q$ and set the adjustment speed $k$ relatively high to make sure that the system has effectively converged to the equilibrium by $Q$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Simulate continuous time version of Keynesian goods market model\n\n#Clear the environment \nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of periods for which you want to simulate\nQ=800\n\n# Set number of parameterisations that will be considered\nS=1\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0=3\nc1=0.8\nk=8\ndelta=0.01\n\n# Construct matrices in which values for different periods will be stored; initialise at 1\nY=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=Q)\nC=matrix(data=1, nrow=S, ncol=Q)\n\n#Construct matrices for exogenous variable \nI0=matrix(data=5, nrow=S, ncol=Q)\n\n#Solve this system recursively based on the initialisation\n  for (t in 2:Q){\n    for (iterations in 1:1000){\n    Y[1,t] = Y[1,t-1] + delta*(k*(C[1,t-1] + I0[1,t-1] - Y[1,t-1]))\n    C[1,t] = c0 + c1*Y[1,t]\n    } # close within-period loop\n  } # close time loop\n\n\n# Verify solutions for Y\n(c0+I0[1,Q])/(1-c1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 40\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nY[1,Q]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 39.9999\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n### Simulate continuous time version of Keynesian goods market model\n\n# Load NumPy\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set number of periods for which you want to simulate\nQ = 800\n\n# Set number of parameterizations that will be considered\nS = 1\n\n# Set fixed parameter values\nc0 = 3\nc1 = 0.8\nk = 8\ndelta = 0.01\n\n# Initialize matrices to store values for different periods\nY = np.ones((S, Q))\nC = np.ones((S, Q))\n\n# Initialize the matrix for the exogenous variable\nI0 = np.full((S, Q), 5)\n\n# Solve this system recursively based on the initialization\nfor t in range(1, Q):\n    for iterations in range(1000):\n        Y[0, t] = Y[0, t - 1] + delta * (k * (C[0, t - 1] + I0[0, t - 1] - Y[0, t - 1]))\n        C[0, t] = c0 + c1 * Y[0, t]\n\n# Verify the solution for Y at time Q\n(c0 + I0[0, Q - 1]) / (1 - c1)\n\nY[0,Q - 1]\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## References\n",
