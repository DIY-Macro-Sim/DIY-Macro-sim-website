By contrast, Michal Kalecki and post-Keynesians such as Nicholas Kaldor argued that a redistribution of income towards profit-earners is likely to reduce consumption, as workers tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume than capital owners. The post-Kaleckian growth model integrates these two mechanisms in a Keynesian framework in which aggregate demand and growth are demand-determined. It allows for wage-led as well as profit-led demand and growth regimes. In a wage-led regime, a redistribution of income towards workers has expansionary effects on aggregate demand (and possibly growth) as the expansionary effect on consumption outweighs the negative effect on investment. In a profit-led regime, the effect is contradictory as investment falls by more than consumption rises. Whether a regime is wage- or profit-led depends on the relative size of the propensities to consume and the propensity to invest.     \n\nThis is a model of long-run steady state growth. In the steady state, all endogenous variables grow at the same rate.^[All variables are normalised by the capital stock and thus rendered stationary.] Changes in parameters or exogenous variables lead to an instantaneous adjustment of the model's variables, so that the model can be analysed like a static one. We consider a version of the model with linear functions based on @hein_distribution_2014, chap. 7.2.2.\n\n## The Model\n\n\n$$\nr=h \\frac{u}{v}\n$$ {#eq-r}\n\n$$\ns=[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]\\frac{u}{v}, \\quad 0 \\geq s_W > s_\\Pi \\geq 1\n$$ {#eq-s}\n\n$$\nc= \\frac{u}{v}-s\n$$ {#eq-c}\n\n$$\ng=g_0+g_1u+g_2h, \\quad g_i > 0\n$$ {#eq-g}\n\n$$\nu=v(c+g)\n$$ {#eq-u}\n\nwhere $r$, $s$, $c$, $g$, and $u$ are the profit rate, the saving rate, the consumption rate, the investment rate, and the rate of capacity utilisation, respectively.\n\n@eq-r decomposes the profit rate into the product of the profit share $h$ (total profits over total output), the rate of capacity utilisation (actual output over potential output), and the inverse of $v$ (the capital-potential output ratio). Let $Y$ be output, $K$ be the capital stock, and $Y^P$ be potential output, the decomposition can also be written as $r=\\frac{\\Pi}{K}=\\frac{\\Pi}{Y}\\frac{Y}{Y^P}\\frac{Y^P}{K}$. The profit share and the capital-potential output ratio are taken to be exogenous in this model. Note also that the wage share is given by $1-h$. By @eq-s, the economy-wide saving rate is given by the sum of saving out of wages ($s_W(1-h)\\frac{u}{v}$) and saving out of profits ($s_\\Pi h\\frac{u}{v}$). It is assumed that workers have a higher marginal propensity to consume than capital owners ($s_W>s_\\Pi$). @eq-c simply states that consumption is income not saved. According to @eq-c, investment is determined by an autonomous component $g_0$ that may capture Keynesian `animal spirits', by the rate of capacity utilisation, and by the profit share. While the rate of capacity utilisation is a signal of (future) demand, the profit share may stimulate investment as internal funds are typically the cheapest source of finance. Finally, @eq-u is an equilibrium condition that assumes that the rate of capacity utilisation adjusts to clear the goods market.\n\nThe key question addressed by this model is a how a change in the profit share affects the rate of capacity utilisation and the rate of growth.^[@bhaduri_unemployment_1990 further discuss the effects on the profit rate.] As shown formally in the analytical discussion below, there is no unambiguous answer to this question as the model encompasses different regimes. Three main regimes can be identified. First, a regime in which both the rate of utilisation and the rate of growth are negatively affected by an increase in the profit share. We will call this a wage-led demand and growth regime (WLD/WLG). Second, a regime in which the rate of utilisation is negatively affected and the rate of growth is positively affected by an increase in the profit share. We will call this a wage-led demand regime and profit-led growth regime (WLD/PLG). Third, a regime in which both the rate of utilisation and the rate of growth are positively affected by an increase in the profit share. We will call this a profit-led demand and growth regime (PLD/PLG).\n\n## Simulation\n\n### Parameterisation\n\nTable 1 reports the parameterisation used in the simulation. We will consider three different parameterisations that represent the three regimes outlined above. For each of these regimes, there is a baseline scenario and a scenario in which the profit share ($h$) rises. This allows to assess the effects on the model's endogenous variables for the different regimes. \n\n**Table 1: Parameterisation**\n\n| Scenario                        | $v$ | $s_W$ | $s_\\Pi$ | $g_0$ | $g_1$ | $g_2$ | $h$ |\n|:-------------------------------:|:---:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---:|\n| 1a: baseline WLD/WLG            |  3  |  0.3  |   0.9   |  0.02 |  0.1  |  0.1  | 0.2 |\n| 1b: rise in profit share ($h$)  |  3  |  0.3  |   0.9   |  0.02 |  0.1  |  0.1  | 0.3 |\n| 2a: baseline WLD/PLG            |  3  |  0.3  |   0.9   |  0.02 |  0.08 |  0.1  | 0.2 |\n| 2b: rise in profit share ($h$)  |  3  |  0.3  |   0.9   |  0.02 |  0.08 |  0.1  | 0.3 |\n| 3a: baseline PLD/PLG            |  3  |  0.3  |   0.9   | -0.01 |  0.1  |  0.1  | 0.2 |\n| 3b: rise in profit share ($h$)  |  3  |  0.3  |   0.9   | -0.01 |  0.1  |  0.1  | 0.3 |\n\n### Simulation code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Clear the environment\nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of scenarios (including baselines)\nS=6\n\n#Create vector in which equilibrium solutions from different parameterisations will be stored\nu_star=vector(length=S) # utilisation rate\ng_star=vector(length=S) # growth rate of capital stock\ns_star=vector(length=S) # saving rate\nc_star=vector(length=S) # consumption rate\nr_star=vector(length=S) # profit rate\n\n# Set exogenous variables whose parameterisation changes across regimes \ng0=vector(length=S) # animal spirits\nsw=vector(length=S) # propensity to save out of wages \nh=vector(length=S)  # profit share\ng1=vector(length=S) # sensitivity of investment with respect to utilisation\n\n### Construct different scenarios across 3 regimes: (1) WLD/WLG, (2) WLD/PLG, (3) PLD/PLG \n\n# baseline WLD/WLG\ng0[1]=0.02\ng1[1]=0.1\nh[1]=0.2\n\n# increase in profit share in WLD/WLG regime\ng0[2]=0.02\ng1[2]=0.1\nh[2]=0.3\n\n# baseline WLD/PLG\ng0[3]=0.02\ng1[3]=0.08\nh[3]=0.2\n\n# increase in profit share in WLD/PLG regime\ng0[4]=0.02\ng1[4]=0.08\nh[4]=0.3\n  \n# baseline PLD/PLG\ng0[5]=-0.01\ng1[5]=0.1\nh[5]=0.2\n\n# increase in profit share in PLD/PLG regime\ng0[6]=-0.01\ng1[6]=0.1\nh[6]=0.3\n\n#Set constant parameter values\nv=3    # capital-to-potential output ratio\ng2=0.1 # sensitivity of investment with respect to profit share\nsp=0.9 # propensity to save out of profits\nsw=0.3 # propensity to save out of wages\n\n#Check Keynesian stability condition for all scenarios\nfor (i in 1:S){\nprint(((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])*(1/v) -g1[i])>0)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n[1] TRUE\n[1] TRUE\n[1] TRUE\n[1] TRUE\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check demand and growth regime for 3 baseline scenarios\nfor (i in c(1,3,5)){\nprint(paste(\"Parameterisation\", i, \"yields:\"))   \nif(g2*(sw/v -

@fig-profit-rate-pkdg depict the response of the model's key endogenous variables to changes in the profit share. In the first case of a wage-led demand and growth regime (WLD/WLG), investment is equally sensitive to a change in the rate of capacity utilisation ($g_1$) and a change in the profit share ($g_2$). A rise in the profit share reduces consumption, which reduces the rate of capacity utilisation and the rate of growth. This is despite a positive effect on the profit rate.^[If the negative effect on the rate of capacity utilisation was stronger, the profit rate could fall as well. See the analytical discussion for a formal derivation of the condition under which this may happen.] \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(u_star, ylab=\"u\", names.arg=c(\"1a:baseline WLD/WLG\", \"1b:rise prof share\", \"2a:baseline WLD/PLG\", \"2b:rise prof share\", \"3a:baseline PLD/PLG\", \"3b: rise prof share\"), cex.names = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rate of capacity utilisation](a_post_kaleckian_distribution_and_growth_model_files/figure-html/fig-utilisation-pkdg-1.png){#fig-utilisation-pkdg width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the second case where the demand regime is wage-led but the growth regime is profit-led (WLD/PLG), investment is slightly less sensitive to a change in the rate of capacity utilisation compared to a change in the profit share.

See @hein_distribution_2014, chap. 7.2.2, for a detailed discussion of their effects.] Consumption ($c$), saving ($s$), investment ($g$), and the rate of utilisation ($u$) form a closed loop (or cycle) within the system.

The profit rate is a residual variable (also called a `sink') in this model.\n\n\n## Analytical discussion\n\nTo find the equilibrium solutions, substitute @eq-s - @eq-g into @eq-u and solve for $u$:\n\\begin{align}\nu^* = \\frac{g_0+g_2h}{[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]v^{-1}-g_1}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe equilibrium solution for $u$ can then be substituted into @eq-g to find:\n\\begin{align}\ng^* = \\frac{(g_0+g_2h)[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]v^{-1}}{[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]v^{-1}-g_1}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe Keynesian stability condition requires $[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]v^{-1}-g_1>0$, i.e. saving need to react more strongly to income than investment.\n\nThe  equilibrium solution for $r$ can be found by substituting $u^*$ into @eq-r:\n\\begin{align}\nr^* = \\frac{h(g_0+g_2h)}{[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]-vg_1}.\n\\end{align}\n\nTo assess whether the demand regime is wage- or profit-led, take the derivative of $u^*$ with respect to $h$:\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial h} = \\frac{\\frac{s_W}{v}(g_0+g_2 )-(g_0\\frac{s_\\Pi}{v} + g_1g_2)}{[[s_W + (s_\\Pi - s_W)h]v^{-1}-g_1]^2}.\n\\end{align}\n\nIt can be seen that, e.g., a higher propensity to save out of wages or negative animal spirits make the regime more likely to be profit-led.\n\nBy the same token, the sign of the derivative of $g^*$ with respect to $h$ determines whether the growth regime is wage- or profit-led:\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial g^*}{\\partial h} = g_1\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial h}+g_2.\n\\end{align} \n\nIt can be seen that, e.g., a higher sensitivity of investment with respect to the profit share makes the regime more likely to be profit-led.  \n\nFinally, the effect on the profit rate will depend on the sign of the derivative:\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial r^*}{\\partial h} = \\frac{u^*}{v} + \\frac{h}{v}\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial h},\n\\end{align}\n\nwhich is likely to be positive but can become negative if the demand regime is strongly wage-led.\n\n\n### Calculate analytical solutions numerically\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Utilisation rate\nfor (i in 1:S){\nprint((g0[i]+g2*h[i])/((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v-g1[i]))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n[1] 0.8333333\n[1] 0.6666667\n[1] 0.625\n[1] 0.25\n[1] 0.3333333\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Growth rate\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  print(((g0[i]+g2*h[i])*(sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v)/((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v-g1[i]))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.14\n[1] 0.1333333\n[1] 0.09333333\n[1] 0.1\n[1] 0.035\n[1] 0.05333333\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Profit rate\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  print((g0[i]+g2*h[i])*(h[i]/v)/((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v-g1[i]))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.06666667\n[1] 0.08333333\n[1] 0.04444444\n[1] 0.0625\n[1] 0.01666667\n[1] 0.03333333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Utilisation rate\nfor i in range(S):\n    print((g0[i]+g2*h[i])/((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v-g1[i]))\n\n# Growth rate\nfor i in range(S):\n    print(((g0[i]+g2*h[i])*(sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v)/((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v-g1[i]))\n    \n# Profit rate\nfor i in range(S):\n    print((g0[i]+g2*h[i])*(h[i]/v)/((sw+(sp-sw)*h[i])/v-g1[i]))\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## References {-}\n",
