While the structural forms of these models are typically complex as behavioural functions are derived from the intertemporal optimisation, the reduced-form of the benchmark models can be represented by three main equations: (i) an IS curve, (ii) a Phillips curve, (iii) and an interest rate rule.\n\n[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-1]: See @gali_state_2018 for an overview.\n\nThe IS curve establishes a negative relationship between real income and the real interest rate. For a higher real interest rate, households will save more and thus consume less. The Phillips curve models inflation as a function of the output gap. A positive output gap (an economic expansion) leads to higher inflation. The monetary policy rule specifies how the central bank reacts to deviations of actual inflation from a politically determined inflation target.\n\nThe simplified version of the 3-equation model we consider here is directly taken from chapter 3 of @Carlin2014.^[A PDF version of the most 2024 edition of the book is freely available [here](https://www.stone-econ.org/resources/free-textbook-in-intermediate-macroeconomics).] This is a short-run model in which prices are flexible but the capital stock is fixed. The focus is thus on goods market equilibrium rather than economic growth. In the Carlin-Soskice version, inflation expectations are assumed to be adaptive and the response of aggregate demand to a change in the interest rate is sluggish. This renders the model dynamic.[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-2]\n\n[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-2]: Note that this is quite different from conventional New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models in which the dynamic element stems from agents with rational expectations that react to serially correlated shocks. See chapter 16 of @Carlin2014 for a comparison of their 3-equation model with New Keynesian DSGE models.]\n\n## The model\n\n$$\ny_t=A -a_1r_{t-1}\n$$ {#eq-nk_y}\n\n$$\n\\pi_t=\\pi_{t-1}+a_2(y_t -y_e)\n$$ {#eq-nk_pi}\n\n$$\nr_s=\\frac{(A - y_e)}{a_1}\n$$ {#eq-nk_rs}\n\n$$\nr_t = r_s + a_3(\\pi_t-\\pi^T)\n$$ {#eq-nk_r}\n\nwhere $y$, $A$, $r$, $\\pi$, $y_e$, $r_s$, and $\\pi^T$ are real output, autonomous demand (times the multiplier), the real interest rate, inflation, equilibrium output, the stabilising real interest rate, and the inflation target, respectively.\n\n@eq-nk_y is the IS curve or goods market equilibrium condition. Aggregate output adjusts to the level of aggregate demand, which is given by autonomous demand (times the multiplier) and a component that is negatively related to the (lagged) real interest rate via households' saving ($a_1>0$). @eq-nk_pi is the Phillips curve. It is assumed that inflation is driven by adaptive expectations ($E[\\pi_{t}]=\\pi_{t-1}$) and positively related to the output gap $(y_t-y_e)$, i.e. $a_2>0$. By @eq-nk_rs, the stabilising real interest rate is that real interest rate that is consistent with equilibrium output ($y_e=A -a_1r_s$). Finally, the interest rate rule in @eq-nk_r specifies the real interest rate the central bank needs to set to minimise its loss function (see @sec-analytical below for a derivation). The parameter $a_3$ is a composite one given by $a_3 = \\frac{1}{a_1(\\frac{1}{a_2 b} + a_2)} >0$. Although the central bank only sets the nominal interest rate $i = r + E[\\pi_{t}]$ directly, the fact that expected inflation is predetermined in every period allows it to indirectly control the real interest rate.\n\n## Simulation\n\n### Parameterisation\n\nTable 1 reports the parameterisation used in the simulation. For all parameterisations, the system is initialised at the equilibrium $(y^*,\\pi^*,r^*)=(y_e,\\pi^T, r_s)$. Three scenarios will then be considered. In scenario 1, there is an increase in autonomous aggregate demand ($A$). In scenario 2, the central bank sets a higher inflation target ($\\pi^T$). Scenario 3 considers a rise in equilibrium output ($y_e$).\n\n**Table 1: Parameterisation**\n\n| Scenario                              | $a_1$ | $a_2$ | $b$ | $A$ | $\\pi^T$ | $y_e$ |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|-------|-----|---- |---------|-------|\n| 1: rise in aggregate demand ($A$)     | 0.3   | 0.7   | 1   | 7   | 2       | 5     |\n| 2: higher inflation target ($\\pi^T$)  | 0.3   | 0.7   | 1   | 6   | 3       | 5     |\n| 3: rise in equilibrium output ($y_e$) | 0.3   | 0.7   | 1   | 6   | 2       | 5.5   |\n\n### Simulation code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Clear the environment\nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of periods\nQ=50\n\n# Set number of scenarios\nS=3\n\n# Set period in which shock/shift will occur\ns=5\n\n# Create (S x Q)-matrices that will contain the simulated data\ny=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Income/output\np=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Inflation rate\nr=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Policy rate\nrs=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Stabilising interest rate\n\n# Set constant parameter values\na1=0.3  # Sensitivity of inflation with respect to output gap \na2=0.7  # Sensitivity of output with respect to interest rate\nb=1     # Sensitivity of central bank to inflation gap\na3=(a1*(1/(b*a2) + a2))^(-1)\n\n# Set parameter values for different scenarios\nA=matrix(data=6,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # autonomous spending\npt=matrix(data=2,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Inflation target\nye=matrix(data=5,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Potential output\n\nA[1,s:Q]=7  # scenario 1: AD boost  \npt[2,s:Q]=3  # scenario 2: higher inflation target\nye[3,s:Q]=5.5  # scenario 3: higher potential output\n\n# Initialise endogenous variables at equilibrium values\ny[,1]=ye[,1]\np[,1]=pt[,1]\nrs[,1]=(A[,1] - ye[,1])/a1 \nr[,1]=rs[,1]\n\n# Simulate the model by looping over Q time periods for S different scenarios\nfor (i in 1:S){\n  \n  for (t in 2:Q){\n    \n    #(1) IS curve\n    y[i,t] = A[i,t] - a1*r[i,t-1]\n    \n    #(2) Phillips Curve\n    p[i,t] = p[i,t-1] +a2*(y[i,t]-ye[i,t])\n    \n    #(3) Stabilising interest rate\n    rs[i,t] = (A[i,t] - ye[i,t])/a1\n    \n    #(4) Monetary policy rule, solved for r\n    r[i,t] = rs[i,t] + a3*(p[i,t]-pt[i,t])\n  \n  } # close time loop\n}   # close scenarios loop\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set number of periods\nQ = 50\n\n# Set number of scenarios\nS = 3\n\n# Set period in which shock/shift will occur\ns = 5\n\n# Create (S x Q) arrays to store simulated data\ny = np.zeros((S, Q))  # Income/output\np = np.zeros((S, Q))  # Inflation rate\nr = np.zeros((S, Q))  # Policy rate\nrs = np.zeros((S, Q))  # Stabilizing interest rate\n\n# Set constant parameter values\na1 = 0.3  # Sensitivity of inflation with respect to output gap\na2 = 0.7  # Sensitivity of output with respect to interest rate\nb = 1     # Sensitivity of the central bank to inflation gap\na3 = (a1 * (1 / (b * a2) + a2)) ** (-1)\n\n# Set parameter values for different scenarios\nA = np.full((S, Q), 6)  # Autonomous spending\npt = np.full((S, Q), 2)  # Inflation target\nye = np.full((S, Q), 5)  # Potential output\n\nA[0, s:Q] = 7  # Scenario 1: AD boost\npt[1, s:Q] = 3  # Scenario 2: Higher inflation target\nye[2, s:Q] = 5.5  # Scenario 3: Higher potential output\n\n# Initialize endogenous variables at equilibrium values\ny[:, 0] = ye[:, 0]\np[:, 0] = pt[:, 0]\nrs[:, 0] = (A[:, 0] - ye[:, 0]) / a1\nr[:, 0] = rs[:, 0]\n\n# Simulate the model by looping over Q time periods for S different scenarios\nfor i in range(S):\n    for t in range(1, Q):\n        # (1) IS curve\n        y[i, t] = A[i, t] - a1 * r[i, t - 1]\n        # (2) Phillips Curve\n        p[i, t] = p[i, t - 1] + a2 * (y[i, t] - ye[i, t])\n        # (3) Stabilizing interest rate\n        rs[i, t] = (A[i, t] - ye[i, t]) / a1\n        # (4) Monetary policy rule, solved for r\n        r[i, t] = rs[i, t] + a3 * (p[i, t] - pt[i, t])\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Plots\n\nFigures @fig-nk-output - @fig-nk-policyrate depict the response of the model's key endogenous variables to various shifts. A permanent rise in aggregate demand (scenario 1) has an instantaneous expansionary effect on output, but also pushes inflation above the target. This induces the central bank to raise the interest rate, which brings down output below equilibrium in the next period. The central bank then gradually lowers the policy rate towards its new higher equilibrium value, where inflation is again stabilised at its target level.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Plot results\n\n# Set maximum period for plots\nTmax=15\n\n# Output under different scenarios\nplot(y[1, 1:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"\", xlim=range(2:(Tmax)), ylab=\"y\", ylim=range(y[1, 1:Tmax],y[3, 1:(Tmax)])) \ntitle(main=\"Output\", xlab = \"Time\",cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(y[2, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=2, lwd=2)\nlines(y[3, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend=c(\"1: aggregate demand boost\", \"2: rise inflation target\", \"3: rise potential output\"), lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Output under different scenarios](a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model_files/figure-html/fig-nk-output-1.png){#fig-nk-output width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Inflation under different scenarios\nplot(p[1, 1:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"\", xlim=range(2:(Tmax)), ylab=expression(pi), ylim=range(p[, 2:Tmax])) \ntitle(main=\"Inflation\", xlab = \"Time\",cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(p[2, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=2, lwd=2)\nlines(p[3, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend=c(\"1: aggregate demand boost\", \"2: rise inflation target\", \"3: rise potential output\"), lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Inflation under different scenarios](a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model_files/figure-html/fig-nk-inflation-1.png){#fig-nk-inflation width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Policy rate under different scenarios\nplot(r[1, 1:(Tmax+1)],type=\"l\", col=1, lwd=2, lty=1, xlab=\"\", xlim=range(2:(Tmax)), ylab=\"r\", ylim=range(r[, 2:Tmax])) \ntitle(main=\"Policy rate\", xlab = \"Time\",cex=0.8 ,line=2)\nlines(r[2, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=2, lwd=2)\nlines(r[3, 1:(Tmax+1)],lty=3, lwd=2)\nlegend(\"right\", legend=c(\"1: aggregate demand boost\", \"2: rise inflation target\", \"3: rise potential output\"), lty=1:3, cex=0.8, bty = \"n\", y.intersp=0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Policy rate under different scenarios](a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model_files/figure-html/fig-nk-policyrate-1.png){#fig-nk-policyrate width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set maximum period for plots\nTmax = 15\n\n# Plot output under different scenarios\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.plot(y[0, :Tmax + 1], label=\"Scenario 1: aggregate demand boost\",\n         color='k', linestyle='solid', linewidth=2)\nplt.plot(y[1, :Tmax + 1], label=\"Scenario 2: Rise inflation target\",\n         color='k', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\nplt.plot(y[2, :Tmax + 1], label=\"Scenario 3: Rise potential output\",\n         color='k', linestyle='dotted', linewidth=2)\n\nplt.title(\"Output under Different Scenarios\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Time\")\nplt.ylabel(\"y\")\nplt.xlim(1, Tmax)\nplt.ylim(np.min(y), np.max(y))\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nAn increase in the central bank's inflation target (scenario 2) gradually raises the inflation rate to a new level. During the adjustment period, the interest rate falls, which temporarily allows for a higher level of output. However, there is no permanent expansionary effect.\n\nBy contrast, an increase in potential or equilibrium output (scenario 3) allows for a permanently higher level of output and a lower real interest rate.\n\n## Introducing rational inflation expectations\nHow do the predictions of the model change when assuming that private actors have rational instead of adaptive inflation expectations? The Phillips curve, @eq-nk_pi of the model, assumes adaptive expectations: $E[\\pi_{t}]=\\pi_{t-1}$. Following chapter 4 of @Carlin2014, a (simplified) way of introducing rational inflation expectations is to assume $E[\\pi_{t}]=\\pi^T$, i.e. rational agents know the central bank's inflation target and assume that future inflation will (on average) be equal to the inflation target. The central bank will only be able to credibly commit to this target if it can deliver $y_t=y_e$ in expectation. This, in turn, requires output to respond instantaneously to the interest rate, so that the IS curve becomes: $y_t=A -a_1r_{t}$.^[The IS curve in the Carlin-Soskice version of the 3-equation model is only loosely based on intertemporal optimisation (see analytical discussion section below). A rigorously derived IS-curve in a New Keynesian model with forward-looking expectations would contain the future expected output gap and expected inflation, see @gali_state_2018.] \n\nWe simulate the model for both adaptive and rational inflation expectations to see how the economy reacts to a one-off 5-percentage point inflationary shock occurring in $t=5$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Clear the environment\nrm(list=ls(all=TRUE))\n\n# Set number of periods\nQ=50\n\n# Set number of scenarios (here: comparison of adaptive and rational expectations)\nS=2\n\n# Set period in which shock/shift will occur\ns=5\n\n# Create (S x Q)-matrices that will contain the simulated data\ny=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Income/output\np=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Inflation rate\nr=matrix(data=0,nrow=S,ncol=Q) # Policy  rate\n\n# Set constant parameter values\na1=0.3  # Sensitivity of inflation with respect to output gap \na2=0.7  # Sensitivity of output with respect to interest rate\nb=1     # Sensitivity of central bank to inflation gap\na3=(a1*(1/(b*a2) + a2))^(-1)\nA=6 # autonomous spending\npt=2 # Inflation target\nye=5 # Potential output\nrs=(A -

The job of the central bank is simpler: it only needs to raise the interest rate in the period the shock occurs to bring the economy back on target in the next period. Compared to adaptive expectations, a less drastic reponse is required.\n\n\n## Directed graph\n\nAnother perspective on the model's properties is provided by its directed graph. A directed graph consists of a set of nodes that represent the variables of the model. Nodes are connected by directed edges. An edge directed from a node $x_1$ to node $x_2$ indicates a causal impact of $x_1$ on $x_2$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Construct auxiliary Jacobian matrix for 7 variables: y, p, r, A, ye, rs, pt\n# where non-zero elements in regular Jacobian are set to 1 and zero elements are unchanged\n\nM_mat=matrix(c(0,0,1,1,0,0,0,\n               1,0,0,0,1,0,0,\n               0,1,0,0,0,1,1,\n               0,0,0,0,0,0,0,\n               0,0,0,0,0,0,0,\n               0,0,0,1,1,0,0,\n               0,0,0,0,0,0,0),7,7, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Create adjacency matrix from transpose of auxiliary Jacobian and add column names\nA_mat=t(M_mat)\n\n# Create directed graph from adjacency matrix\nlibrary(igraph)\ndg=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A_mat, mode=\"directed\", weighted=NULL)\n\n# Define node labels\nV(dg)$name=c(\"y\", expression(pi), \"r\", \"A\", expression(y[e]),expression(r[s]), expression(pi^T))\n\n# Plot directed graph\nplot(dg, main=\"Figure 4: Directed graph of 3-Equation model\", vertex.size=20, vertex.color=\"lightblue\", \n     vertex.label.color=\"black\", edge.arrow.size=0.3, edge.width=1.1, edge.size=1.2,\n     edge.arrow.width=1.2, edge.color=\"black\", vertex.label.cex=1.2, \n     vertex.frame.color=\"NA\", margin=-0.08)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model_files/figure-html/nk3-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Directed graph\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n# Define the Jacobian matrix\nM_mat = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 ])\n\n# Create adjacency matrix from transpose of auxiliary Jacobian and add column names\nA_mat = M_mat.transpose()\n\n# Create the graph from the adjacency matrix\nG = nx.DiGraph(A_mat)\n\n# Define node labels\nnodelabs = {\n    0: \"y\",\n    1: \"π\",\n    2: \"r\",\n    3: \"A\",\n    4: \"yₑ\",\n    5: \"rₛ\",\n    6: \"πᵀ\"\n}\n\n# Plot the directed graph\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=43)  \nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, labels=nodelabs, node_size=300, node_color='lightblue', \n        font_size=10)\nedge_labels = {(u, v): '' for u, v in G.edges}\nnx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels, font_color='black')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nIn Figure 4, it can be seen that aggregate demand ($A$), equilibrium output ($y_e$), and the inflation target ($\\pi^T$) are the key exogenous variables of the model. All other variables are endogenous and form a closed loop (or cycle) within the system. The upper-right side of the graph represents the supply side, given by the equilibrium level of output and its effect on inflation. The upper-left side captures the demand side and its effect on actual output. The key endogenous variables, output, inflation, and the interest rate form the centre of the graph, where they stand in a triangular relationship to each other. Output drives inflation, which in turn impacts the real interest rate. The latter then feeds back into output. Structural changes in the relationship between demand and supply (e.g. excess demand) also impact the system through their effect on the stabilising interest rate ($r_s$).\n\n## Analytical discussion {#sec-analytical}\n\n### Derivation of core equations\n\n#### IS curve\n\nThe IS curve in @eq-nk_y is loosely based on the consumption Euler equation introduced in @sec-neoclassical-model. Suppose there are two periods and the household maximises its utility function $U=\\ln(C_t) + \\beta \\ln(C_{t+1})$ subject to the intertemporal budget constraint $C_t+\\frac{C_{t+1}}{1+r}=Y_t + \\frac{Y_{t+1}}{1+r}$. Substituting the constraint into the objective function and differentiating with respect to $C_t$ yields the first-order condition:\n\n$$\nC_t = \\frac{C_{t+1}}{\\beta(1+r)}.\n$$\n\nThis consumption Euler equation establishes the negative relationship between the real interest rate and expenditures in @eq-nk_y.\n\n#### PC curve\n\nThe Phillips curve @eq-nk_pi is derived from wage- and price-setting in imperfect labour markets.[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-3] Consider the following wage- and price-setting functions: $$\n\\frac{W}{P^E} = B + \\alpha(y_t - y_e) + z_w \n$$ $$\nP=(1+\\mu)\\frac{W}{\\lambda},\n$$ {#eq-nk_P}\n\n[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-3]: See chapter 2 of @Carlin2014 for details.\n\ni.e. the nominal wage $W$, adjusted for the expected price level, is increasing in the output gap, a factor $B$ capturing unemployment benefits and the disutility of work as well as a vector $z_w$ of wage-push factors. Prices are set based on a constant mark-up ($\\mu$) on unit labour cost ($\\frac{W}{\\lambda}$).\n\nIn equilibrium, the real wage is given by: $w_e = B + z_w$. In a dynamic setting, wage setters will raise the expected real wage by $\\left(\\frac{W_t}{P_{t}^E}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{W_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\\right)=\\alpha(y_t - y_e)$. Together with adaptive expectations for prices $\\hat{P_t^E} = \\hat{P}_{t-1}$ and the approximation $\\hat{W_t} - \\hat{P_{t-1}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{W_t}{P_{t}^E}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{W_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\\right)$, this yields the following equation for wage inflation: $$\n\\hat{W_t} = \\hat{P}_{t-1} +\\alpha(y_t - y_e).\n$$ {#eq-nk_W}\n\nTransforming equation @eq-nk_P into growth rates ($\\hat{P}=\\hat{W}$) and combining it with the wage-inflation equation @eq-nk_W yields the Phillips curve @eq-nk_pi.\n\n#### Monetary policy rule\n\nFinally, to derive the interest rate rule, start from the following central bank loss function:[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-4]\n\n[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-4]: See chapter 2 of @Carlin2014 for details.\n\n$$\nL=(y_t-y_e)^2 + b(\\pi_t - \\pi^T)^2. \n$$ Substituting the Phillips curve (@eq-nk_pi) into the loss function, differentiating with respect to $y_t$, and simplifying yields the first-order condition:\n\n$$\ny_t-y_e = -a_2b(\\pi_t-\\pi^T),\n$$\n\nwhich can also be regarded as a monetary policy rule. Next, substitute the Phillips curve (@eq-nk_pi), the IS-curve (@eq-nk_y), and the stabilising interest rate (@eq-nk_rs) into the monetary policy rule and define $a_3 = \\frac{1}{a_1(\\frac{1}{a_2b} + a_2)}$, which yields the interest rate rule (@eq-nk_r).\n\n### Equilibrium solutions and stability analysis\n\nBy definition, in the steady state we have $y^*=y_e$. This implies that $r^*=r_s$. From this, it follows that $\\pi^* = \\pi^T$.\n\nTo analyse the dynamic stability of the model, we rewrite it as a system of first-order difference equations. To this end, substitute @eq-nk_y into @eq-nk_pi, which yields: $$\n\\pi_t = \\pi_{t-1} + a_2(A - a_1r_{t-1}-y_e)\n$$ {#eq-nk_pi_reduc}\n\nSubstitute this equation into @eq-nk_r, which yields: $$\nr_t= r_{s} + a_3[\\pi_{t-1} + a_2(A - a_1r_{t-1}-y_e) - \\pi^T].\n$$ {#eq-nk_r_reduc}\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system in @eq-nk_y, @eq-nk_pi_reduc, and @eq-nk_r_reduc is given by: $$\nJ=\\begin{bmatrix} 0& 0 &-a_1 \\\\0 & 1 & -a_1 a_2 \\\\ 0 & a_3 & -a_1 a_2 a_3 \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$ The eigenvalues of the Jacobian can be obtained from the characteristic polynomial $\\lambda^3 - Tr(J)\\lambda^2 + [Det(J_1) + Det(J_2) + Det(J_3)]\\lambda - Det(J) = 0$, where $Tr(J)$ and $Det(J$) are the trace and determinant, respectively, and $Det(J_i)$ refers to the $i_{th}$ principal minor of the matrix. As there is a column in the Jacobian that only contains zeros, it follows that the matrix is singular and will have a zero determinant. In addition, all principal minors turn out to be zero. The characteristic polynomial thus reduces to $\\lambda^2[\\lambda - Tr(J)]=0$. From this, it is immediate that $\\lambda_{1,2}=0$ and $\\lambda_{3}=Tr(J)$, where $Tr(J)=1-a_1a_2a_3=\\frac{1}{1+a_2^2b}$. Stability requires the single real eigenvalue to be smaller than unity (in absolute terms). With $\\lambda_3=\\frac{1}{1+a_2^2b}$, stability thus only requires $a_2 \\neq 0$ and $b>0$, i.e. the output gap needs to impact inflation (otherwise the key channel through which interest rate policy brings inflation back on target is blocked) and the central bank needs to assign a (non-negative) loss to deviations of actual inflation from its target.[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-5]\n\n[^a_new_keynesian_3_equation_model-5]: As mentioned in footnote 2, this property of the Carlin-Soskice model is very different from conventional New Keynesian models with rational expectations. In these models, variables such as output and inflation are driven by the 'forward-looking' behaviour of rational agents, i.e. they depend on expectational terms for their current values rather than lagged values. To ensure what is called 'determinancy', these forward-looking variables must adjust fast (or 'jump') to bring the economy back onto a path that is consistent with the optimising equilibrium. This requires the number of jump variables to be matched by an equal number of unstable roots (i.e. being outside the unit circle).\n\nWe can verify these analytical solutions by comparing them with the results from the numerical solution:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Construct Jacobian matrix \nJ=matrix(c(0,0,-a1,\n           0,1,-a1*a2,\n           0,a3,-a1*a2*a3), 3, 3, byrow=TRUE)\n\n# Obtain eigenvalues\nev=eigen(J)\n(values <- ev$values)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.6711409 0.0000000 0.0000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Obtain determinant and trace\ndet(J)       # determinant\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(diag(J)) # trace\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.6711409\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Construct Jacobian matrix \nJ = np.array([[0, 0, -a1],\n          [0, 1, -a1 * a2],\n          [0, a3, -a1 * a2 * a3],])\n\n# Calculate eigenvalues\neigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(J)\n\n# Print the resulting eigenvalues\nprint(eigenvalues)\n\n# Calculate the determinant and trace of the Jacobian matrix\ndeterminant = np.linalg.det(J)\ntrace = np.trace(J)\nprint(determinant)\nprint(trace)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## References\n",
