After that, it jumps right into a series of macroeconomic models. These models are grouped into static and dynamic models. In static models, time plays no role and all variables adjust instantaneously. By contrast, dynamic models characterise the adjustment of variables over time. \n\nThe model entries are largely self-contained and can be read independently of each other. For each model, the chapters provide three main components:\n\n1. **Model descriptions** that concisely explain the key ideas, assumptions, and equations of each model. This helps users grasp the underlying concepts and intuition behind the models.\n2. **Annotated code** that allows users to numerically simulate the models, examine their results under different scenarios, and produce visualisations to better understand the models' structure and output. This hands-on approach enables users to gain practical coding skills while exploring different macroeconomic theories.\n3. **Analytical discussions** for users who are interested in delving deeper into the mathematical properties of the models.\n\nTo further facilitate the understanding of dynamic models, @sec-stab_analysis of the section on dynamic models begins with a general introduction into the  mathematical analysis of dynamic models (this is mostly relevant for the analytical discussions of dynamic models).\n\nAll simulation codes are written in the open-source programming languages *R* and *Python*. *R* codes are presented in the main text (and images and results in the text are the output of the shown *R* codes), while the corresponding *Python* codes are available by clicking on the callout blocks underneath the *R* codes. \n\n## Access to *R* and *Python* and some online resources\nTo be able to manipulate the codes from this website on your own machine, you first need to [download and install *R* and *RStudio*](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). For Python, there are different options. One of them is to download and install *Spyder* via the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). *Spyder* provides an interface for *Python* (like *RStudio* for *R*). If you install it via *Anaconda*, it will install *Python* automatically.\n\nBesides being free, a key advantage of both *R* and *Python* is their huge and growing functionality due to new user-written libraries and packages continuously being added. In addition, a large amount of learning material is freely available on the web, e.g. [here](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp) for *R* and [here](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/), and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) for *Python*. However, to get started in can be best to directly delve into some of the codes on this website and learn by doing. To this end, the following \"cheatsheets\" that provide a concise overview of key functions are useful:\n\n- [R Studio Cheatsheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rstudio-ide-1.pdf)\n\n- [Base R Cheatsheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)\n\n- [more R cheatsheets here](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)\n\n- [Python Basics Cheatsheet](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/v1694526244/Marketing/Blog/Python_Basics_Cheat_Sheet-updated.pdf)\n\n- [Python for Data Science Cheatsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PythonForDataScience.pdf)\n\n- [Python Cheatsheet for NumPy library](https://assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)\n\nOnce you have installed *R* or *Python*, you can play with the codes on this website yourself by copy and pasting them into the script panel of your local interface (IDE) and hitting CTRL + Enter to execute them. Don't forget to always comment your code using the \"#\" symbol and to save your scripts to make sure your future self can seamlessness continue working on it.\n\n\n## Introduction to *R* and *Python*\nThe following codes cover some basic operations.^[We are grateful to Rafael Wildauer for permission to reproduce a slightly modified version of his learning materials. In addition, some of the material below is taken from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp).] There are also some simple exercises to work through. Open *RStudio* or *Spyder* on your machine to get started.\n\n\n### Setting your working directory\nA first step is often to set the working directory, which is the folder on your PC where any output you produce will be stored (e.g. simulated data, graphs). \nTo set the working directory, you need to find the path to the folder on your PC where you want to store results:\n\n- [finding the path to a folder on your Microsoft PC](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-File%27s-Path-on-Windows)\n- [finding the path to a folder on your Mac](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-find-and-copy-a-file-path-on-mac/)\n\nNote that folders in the path to your working directory need to be separated by forward slashes: /\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n################################### Set working directory ###########################\n# Set the working directory to the desired folder by adjusting the path below:\n# setwd(\"C:/Users/Your Name/Your Folder\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python code\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Set the working directory to the desired folder by adjusting the path below:\nimport os\n# os.chdir(\"\"C:/Users/Your Name/Your Folder\")  \n```\n:::\n\n\n::: \n\n### Elementary operations\n- the following block of code covers some elementary operations\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n################################### Elementary operations ###########################\n\n#In the R script you write code and comments\n#any line starting with # is a comment and it is NOT executed\n\n#Let's define some variables\ns = 0.05\nY = 10\n\n#We can also assign several variables the same value at once\nC = I = R = 2\n\n#For displaying them we simply call the name of the object and execute the relevant line\nY\nC\n\n#We can define new variables using existing ones\nW = Y - R\nW\n\n#R has a vast amount of built in functions, for example\nmax(10,2,100,-3)\nsqrt(9)\nabs(-13)\n\n#you can find out more about these by using the help function, e.g.:?max()\n\n#How can you delete stuff?
